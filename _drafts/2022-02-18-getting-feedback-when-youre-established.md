title: Getting Feedback When You're Established

In [Giving Feedback When You're
New](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2022/02/13/providing-feedback-to-engineers),
I talked about how to calibrate and offer feedback as a new teammate.
What about when you're established? Surely that's easier right? Maybe!
While you may gain the benefit of experience, that can now mean a few things:

1. Feedback loops grow longer so it takes longer to find out when we're wrong
2. People may be more inclined to think you're right even when you're not
3. If someone thinks you're wrong, they may feel less comfortable telling you

So how do we deal with these challenges?

### Dealing with Long Feedback Loops
Imagine putting a hand on a hot stove. We immediately find out it's a bad idea
and pull our hand away. What if you couldn't feel that the heat for 5-10
seconds? That's the danger of a long feedback loop.

As we get more engineering experience, the feedback loops get longer, so it can
take time to find out if a project went well.
Similarly, if we make a poor decision, it could be a long time until we see that
decision come home to roost!

At Amazon, for example, the engineers on the engineering ladder have scope roughly like:

* **Software Development Engineer I (SDE I)**: Tasks / features / small components
* **SDE II**: Component / service level with some team leadership
* **Senior SDE**: Team level with some cross-team alignment
* **Principal Engineer**: Organization level+

As we move up the ladder, these feedback loops increase in time and consequences grow.
A newer enginer may be able to find out if their idea works in
hours to days. A typical task for an SDE II might span a week to a few
months for larger projects. A Senior SDE-scope project could have a feedback
loop ranging from a few months to a year or more. I can only imagine what it's
like at the Principal Engineer level.

What if we predicted improperly and it won't pan out? We have to be more
cautious as we grow. We're more likely to make a decision
that could be difficult to reverse. At
Amazon, these are called ["one-way door
decisions"](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html).
Having a short feedback loop is critical for improving and making the right decisions.

So what should we do as the feedback loops get longer? *Find out where you could
be wrong while it's cheap!* It's easier to discover a plan's faults
during planning than after delivery.

Here's a few recommendations:

* **Coordinate with the stakeholders**. Keeping a close line of communication
  with those most involved in your project or initiative can help course
  correct. For example, perhaps we're taking a dependency on a team to have
  a component ready in 6 months. We need to know if something happened that
  changed timelines. Maybe their roadmap changed and it won't be ready for
  a year now!
* **Seek diverse feedback**. Invite stakeholders and other team members to offer
  what we could be overlooking. Perhaps there's an expert in a particular
  technology you're choosing that you could leverage! (As an aside: if there's
  not a mechanism to review designs,
  perhaps consider starting one or having an open-door policy for discussing
  designs with teammates.)
* **Communicate progress**. Proactive communication has a much higher value at
  higher seniority levels. The work we do may be seen by many, and it's possible
  there will be a wide group that's eagerly looking to see what path you take.
  If it's a pull-based communication, where someone has to ask what you're
  working on and how it's going, that will wind up costing a lot of time and
  have a smaller impact on who we can reach.

This also comes up regularly on the Staff Eng podcast.

### Appearing Right When We're Wrong

#### Overcoming the Halo Effect

#### Lean on Active Listening

#### Acknowledge Mistakes

### Ask for Feedback

#### Stay Present

#### Beware Defensiveness

#### Use the Beginner's Mind

As we gain experience, it becomes increasingly difficult to see the faults in
our thinking and the decisions grow in consequence. We have to take care to avoid
mistakes because it could take a while for us to see them as such. We need to
encourage others to others to speak and take the lead, and listen to what they say.
 Lastly, we need to actively request feedback and acknowledge when we're wrong.

By taking these steps, we can hopefully avoid falling into the trappings of experience.
