title: Getting Feedback When You're Established

In [Giving Feedback When You're
New](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2022/02/13/providing-feedback-to-engineers),
I talked about how to calibrate and offer feedback as a new teammate.
What about when you're established? Surely that's easier right? As with so many
things in engineering, there's trade-offs! While you may gain the benefit of
experience, scope and ambiguity increases. That can means:

1. It takes longer to see how well a decision turns out and if we made the right choice
2. Others may be more inclined to think you're right even when you're not
3. If someone thinks you're wrong, they may feel less comfortable telling you

So how do we deal with these challenges? How can we make good decisions and find
our blind spots?

### Dealing with Long Feedback Loops

Imagine putting a hand on a hot stove. We immediately find out it's a bad idea
and pull our hand away. What if you couldn't feel that the heat for 5-10
seconds? That's the danger of a long feedback loop.

As we get more engineering experience, the projects grow larger and it can
take time to find out if a project went well.
Similarly, if we make a poor decision, it could be a while until we see that
decision come home to roost!

Amazon's engineering ladder ties ambiguity and scope to the engineering levels.
At each level, engineers have focuses roughly as follows:

* **Software Development Engineer I (SDE I)**: Tasks / features / small components
* **SDE II**: Component / service level with team leadership
* **Senior SDE**: Team-level architectures with cross-team alignment
* **Principal Engineer**: Organization level+

As we move up the ladder, these feedback loops increase in time and consequences grow.
A newer enginer may be able to find out if their idea works in
hours to days. A typical task for an SDE II might span a week to a few
months for larger projects. A Senior SDE-scope project could range from a few
months to a year or more. I can only imagine what it's like at the Principal
Engineer level.

We have to be more cautious as we grow. We're more likely to make a decision
that could be difficult to reverse. At Amazon, these are called ["one-way door
decisions"](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html).
It may not be possible to back out of a poor decision, and setting an
organization in the wrong direction may be challenging to correct.

Given that the project scope grows, how can we shorten the feedback loop? *Find
out where you could be wrong while it's cheap!* It's easier to discover a plan's faults
during planning than after delivery.

Here's a few recommendations:

* **Coordinate with stakeholders**. Keep in close-contact
  with those most involved in your project or initiative. Do you have
  a dependency on another team? Align with them as soon as possible.
  For example, perhaps we're taking a dependency on a team to have
  a component ready in 6 months. We need to know if something happened that
  changed timelines. Maybe their roadmap changed and it won't be ready for
  a year!

* **Seek varied feedback**. Involve those who will be most affected by your
  work, and seek out opinions from team members or colleagues who feel
  passionate about the topic. They may help you see something you've overlooked.
  what we could be overlooking. Perhaps there's an expert in a particular
  technology you're choosing that you could leverage! (As an aside: if there's
  not a mechanism to review designs,
  perhaps consider starting one or having an open-door policy for discussing
  designs with teammates.)

* **Use push-based communication**. Proactive communication has a much higher
  value at higher seniority levels. What this means is actively shaping and
  communicating progress as we go, rather than when asked. The work may be
  seen by many, and it's
  possible there will be a group that's eagerly looking to see what path
  you take, and how it worked. If we rely a pull-based communication,
  it costs a lot of time, misses an opportunity to build trust, and
  can lead to diminished impact.

Dealing with a long feedback loop is a topic that comes up on the StaffEng
podcast. In particular, [Rich Lafferty of
PagerDuty](https://podcast.staffeng.com/1687069/9043003-rich-lafferty-pagerduty)
talks about seeking early feedback and growing a feedback group over time.

### Appearing Right When We're Wrong

#### Overcoming the Halo Effect

#### Lean on Active Listening
Active Listening, in short, is hearing what the other person is saying rather
than focusing on what we're going to say next. It can be hard to be present!

#### Acknowledge Mistakes

### Ask for Feedback

#### Stay Present

#### Beware Defensiveness

#### Use the Beginner's Mind

As we gain experience, it becomes increasingly difficult to see the faults in
our thinking and the decisions grow in consequence. We have to take care to
avoid mistakes because it could take a while for us to see them as such. We need
to encourage others to others to speak and take the lead, and listen to what
they say. Lastly, we need to actively request feedback and acknowledge when
we're wrong.

By taking these steps, we can hopefully avoid falling into the trappings of experience.
