When I worked at Amazon, I found the promotion process a bit mysterious in the
beginning. How does the business decide who to promote? And why would they ever
want to promote me, a lowly engineer suffering from impostor syndrome? How did
this actually work?

My promotion journey took (to me) a while. It took about 2 years, from
when managers first started to tell me that I was nearly ready for promotion.
I don't think they're wrong to say or offer this, but I remember finding it
frustrating along the way. What was actually required for promotion and why
wasn't I being considered for it?

In time, my view of this has softened. There's a few architectural reasons that
Amazon is slow to promote. One is: it wants to pay engineers less. It behooves
Amazon if they only promote engineers after they have been consistently
operating in the role for a while. It de-risks the decision.

A second reason is that Amazon wants you to succeed in the role. Because levels
at Amazon are public, and each level has different expectations, as soon as
you're promoted those who may not have worked with you before may start to treat
you differently. While you may have been an excellent engineer at a mid-level
position, you suddenly are judged against all of the other engineers at
a senior-level position after promotion. That can cover a wide band, including
people who are working on their promotion to Principal / Staff-level roles!

As a former manager
once said, "Amazon will happily promote you when it realizes there's been an
error and oh let's just change a few notes on their file to indicate they're
operating at the next level."

During the process of preparing for promotion, I'd say it took me about a year
to prepare what I thought was a comprehensive set of work documents describing
what I had done, how I contributed to the organization's success, and how I was
operating at the next level. I looked at the guidance for moving to the next
level, prepared a document describing where I was as compared to the official
guidance, and added a narrative for as many bullets as I could. In some spots,
I saw gaps, which I worked to close or find new anecdotes to address.

I had a bit of a wake-up call when I reviewed some
of these documents with a higher-level engineer, who asked me fair questions
like "Ok, great, I see that you did a good job in this case. How did you widen
your impact here? Did you help other teams avoid the same mistakes? Build
a mechanism that prevented this kind of thing from happening again?" And he was
right - I hadn't done those things.

For the following year, I worked on a larger project that spanned multiple teams
and involved coordination with about 10 engineers. I set up design reviews,
worked with multiple stakeholders, and had many moments where I said to myself
"Ah, so **this** is it what it's like to operate as a senior engineer." An
example: implementing a critical component which is the backbone for a new
service; coordinating with an overlooked customer to make sure their use case
was met by what we were building; identifying a way to programmatically verify
our new service's behavior matched expectations. Each time, I felt a moment of
realization and like I was finally cresting what I needed to understand to
operate at the next level.

Each time I was wrong. At Amazon, at least, promotions happen when you're
identified as demonstrably and consistently operating at the next level. This
meant, in a way, that any time I wasn't feeling like "Ah, this is what it's like
to be a senior engineer!" meant an opportunity where I was perhaps not operating
at the next level!

When we completed that project, I prepared a promotion document and made sure
I crossed all the line items in the Moving To criteria for the next level.
I heard some feedback that the promotion may be rejected, and I chose to go
forward with it anyway. I wanted to find out my weaknesses, and one of the best
ways to do that is to submit and try again later. As expected, the promotion was
rejected, though I gained a mentor from it and worked with the mentor to close
the identified gaps.

Six months later, we re-submitted the packet and included artifacts to mitigate
the gaps, and it went through! I was relieved.

Looking back now, I see that the time while I was incubating as an engineer
operating between levels was helpful. It gave me an opportunity to grow and
prove myself. Once I officially had the title, people stopped considering me as
a new engineer - that was wiped out. Instead, I was treated at the same level as
those that had been in the role for some time.

Looking forward, I have a difficult time imagining a path to a staff engineer
role, though I have to say that is probably impostor syndrome rearing its head.
Anyway, as I said earlier, it's better to focus on the journey than the
destination. As difficult as that can feel.
