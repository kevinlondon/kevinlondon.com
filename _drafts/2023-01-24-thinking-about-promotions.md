When I worked at Amazon, I initally found the promotion process mysterious. How
does the business decide who to promote? What criteria do they use? And why
would they ever want to promote *me*, a lowly engineer suffering from [impostor
syndrome](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/27/impostor-syndrome-and-me)?

My promotion journey took about 2 years from when managers first started to tell
me I was nearly ready for promotion. While I found it frustrating at times,
I came to realize that Amazon took a cautious approach to promotions for a few
reasons:

1. Amazon wants to promote engineers who have consistently demonstrated their
   ability to perform at the next level. This helps to minimize the risk of
   promoting someone before they are truly ready.

2. Job levels at Amazon are public, and each level has different expectations.
As soon as you're promoted, others may start treating you differently, so
delaying the promotion until you've proven you're ready protects you from that
judgement.

During my own journey towards promotion, I spent about a year preparing
a comprehensive set of work summaries that detailed my contributions to the
organization and how I was operating at the next level. When I reviewed these
documents with a higher-level engineer, they pointed out areas where I could
improve and broaden my impact. For example, they asked me how I had helped
other teams avoid the mistakes I had encountered, and what mechanisms I had put
in place to prevent similar issues in the future.

I took this feedback to heart when I worked on a larger project that spanned
multiple teams and required coordination with about 10 engineers. Throughout
this project, I had many moments where I thought to myself, "Ah, this is what
it's like to operate as a senior engineer." Each time, I realized that there
I still had more to learn. Promotions at Amazon happen when you are
consistently operating at the next level. So, any time I didn't feel like
a senior engineer, it meant I had an opportunity to improve.

After we shipped the project, I prepared a promotion document and made sure
I met the criteria for the next level. I received feedback that the
promotion may not be approved, but I decided to go through with it anyway.
I wanted to find out my weaknesses and submitting and trying again later was the
best way to do that. As expected, the promotion was rejected. Again, I learned from
the experience, and was able to improve
for the next time. And eventually, I got promoted.

In conclusion, the promotion process can be a long and sometimes frustrating
journey. With a better understanding of the company's perspective and
a willingness to learn and improve, you can increase your chances of success.
Keep pushing and you will (hopefully!) be recognized for your efforts. Don't
give up. Even if you face rejections, so long as you keep improving,
you can achieve your goals.
