Finding and landing a good tech job can range from painful to, at best,
uncomfortable and time consuming, depending on your experience and location.

I recently completed a job hunt of my own and wound up at
[ChowNow](https://www.chownow.com/). Many things can go wrong during a job hunt.
I'd like to share lessons and war stories to help you find and get a job
that you like. We'll cover finding a job, interviewing, and negotiating an
offer.

### Personal Stats

For background, over about a 3 month period for most recent search I:

* Applied to 25 places
* Interviewed with 9 companies over the phone
* Completed 6 technical interviews

In addition, I've interviewed around 20 technical candidates and a number of
interns in previous posiitons, so I have experience with interviews from the
other side of the table as well.

Finding Jobs
------------

There are many different ways to hear about opportunities that interest you -
from job postings to recruiters to friends that work at other companies.
It can be hard to sift through your options to find the good ones.

### Check job sites

I think there's something to the saying that "the best jobs aren't advertised".
That said, most tech companies want to hire great talent, so they tend to leave
job postings up even when they're not actively looking.

Sites I've used:

* **[Hacker News - Who's Hiring?](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring)**:
  Posted on the first of each month. I like that it gives you a direct line to
  someone who works at the company and it feels more personal than most job
  postings.
* **[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm)**: Even if you don't use
  their job listings, Glassdoor reviews can provide an excellent way to
  see what other employees have said about working at a company. As with all
  internet reviews, take what you read with a grain of salt.
* **[Angel List](https://angel.co/)**: Mostly for startups. I applied to a few
  companies through here but did not find any good fits.
* **[Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/)**: Pretty good
    and easy to browse. It's also how Stack Overflow supports itself, so worth
    a look I think.
* **[Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com)**: A startup that interviews you and,
    if you pass their interviews, fast tracks you to YCombinator startups. That
    currently means you can bypass the application and initial phone
    screen. I think it's good to practice for technical interviews and
    this offers a low-risk way to do that.

If you'd like to work remotely:

* [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
* [Working Nomads](http://www.workingnomads.co/jobs)
* [Remotive](http://remotive.io/)


### Look into local options

Many larger companies have satellite branches that may be an option for you if
you'd prefer not to move. For example, Microsoft and Google have satellite
branches in Los Angeles and Snapchat, Tinder, Riot Games are based here.  You
may find nice surprises if you look around.

### Configure LinkedIn to work for you

First, you'll probably want to [turn off your activity notifications](
https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/78/~/showing-or-hiding-activity-updates-about-you).
If you make changes to your job description or the place that you live and
LinkedIn broadcasts your change to your coworkers, you may raise suspicions.

If you'd like to relocate, set your city to the place you'd like to move.
Recruiters tend to search in the company's local area for talent. I worked with
someone that did this and it led him to a new job. He didn't get help with
relocation that time but many companies offer that as well.

Finally, review what you have on your profile and see if it reflects the kind of
job you want next. Do you list a number of QA-related skills but want to build
web application APIs? Reorganizing your profile can help present a clear picture
of your direction and attract job postings relevant to your interests.

### Attend local meetups

Whatever your interest in tech, you can probably find a [local Meetup
group](http://www.meetup.com/) for it. Attending them has a number of
positives:

* It's a great way to find other places to apply. Companies that host meetups
  usually do so because they want to hire candidates, they want to foster good
  will with the community, or promote their engineering culture. As a job
  seeker, those all work in your favor.

* You can talk with other developers in your community, which has
its own benefits. Others might have a different perspective on technical
topics or may offer you a view into their experience
working for a company you'd like to join. I've also made a few good
friends through meetups.

* You may pick up new ideas from meetup presenters,
which gives you something to talk about in interviews.

* If you're interested in speaking, meetups are a great way to practice.
Speaking at meetups also offers
a way to feel like you're an expert in some area and deepen your knowledge.
During interviews, I felt more comfortable talking about topics I presented.


Application Preparation
------------

Let's say you found a few places to apply. What's next?

### Update your resume

Organize your resume to what you want to do, as with your LinkedIn profile
earlier. Keep it short and focused around [what you
achieved](http://www.quintcareers.com/accomplishment-resume-samples/) at
previous positions rather than your responsibilities. For example:

* "Responsible for database management with MySQL and Percona." - ok.
* "Optimized query times for 10 most common queries yielding 30%
  improvement in MySQL performance." - much better.

[This
article](https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/job-hunting/6-tips-for-writing-an-effective-resume)
has a set of recommendations in it as well.

I once applied for a tech job at a company that serves the film industry. I had
experience as a film colorist and left it on my resume because I felt it would
be relevant. I got questioned about it at every single interview. It usually
went like this:

Them: "Are you sure you don't want to be a colorist?"
Me: "Yes, that's why I'm applying here!"
Them: "You mean you don't want to work in the film indstry?"
Me: -places face in palm-

Hopefully that does not happen to you. If you craft your resume so that you're
putting the most relevant skills on it, I think you'll do fine.

If you have questions about your resume, you can send it to me and I'll
offer some feedback as well.

### Keep a spreadsheet to track where you apply

I kept a Google Spreadsheet with a list of the places I had applied,
description of each position, dates for each interview, and
notes or thoughts I had along the way.

Detailed notes can help you decide which company to choose, especially if
you get more than one offer, and can come in handy if you don't pass the
interviews and would like to reapply later.

### Keep a positive attitude

A job hunt can challenge you in unexpected ways and it may take longer than
you thought, so keeping a positive attitude can help you through the tougher
parts and the doubt.

I looked for an apartment with my girlfriend for a long time. We had a fixed
price range and a firm idea of where we wanted to live. In our search, we found
place after place that looked dumpy, small, or "not for, shall we say, the
culinary wizard" (aka the kitchen was a hotplate and a mini-fridge). We looked
at 30 apartments until we found the right one for us.

Stick with it, even if it feels impossible.
It's always hard looking for a new job and that's true even
though we have the great fortune of being in-demand.

If you're looking for some ways to help with the mental part of job hunting,
I find meditation and exercise helpful for dealing with feelings of frustration
or worry.

### Plan on applying and interviewing at more than one place

I have a friend that applied to one place, interviewed there, and accepted the
job. He says he feels fortunate that it worked out so well but he also
wishes he had applied to more companies for a number of reasons:

1. It gives you a better understanding of your options.
2. It prevents you from fixating on a single company.
3. You may be put into a position where you have to hire others shortly. Having
   more experience with interviews can be helpful when you're on the other side.

If you're looking for a number on how many places to apply, you could apply the
[Secretary Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem) algorithm.
Essentially, you can plan on interviewing and talking to a few places and then
pick the next one that looks better than all those you've talked to so far.

### Determine your salary range

How?

[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) has options for finding local
salary ranges. Similarly, you could use Payscale or Salary.com. The numbers may
be out of date because they're historical and they'll change over time but it
can offer an overview of your particular market.  There's also
[excellent](https://www.roberthalf.com/sites/default/files/Media_Root/images/rht-pdfs/robert_half_technology_2016_salary_guide.pdf)
[salary
guides](http://get.hired.com/rs/348-IPO-044/images/Hired-State-of-Salaries.pdf)
for those specifically in technical fields.

Worst case, you could take what your current salary and bonuses and add 10-20%
for a starting range.


### What do you want?

The two most common questions interviewers asked me:

* Why do you want to leave?
* What would you like from your next job?

Answer truthfully but avoid saying anything too negative. "I'm ready for new
challenges and I've tried to change x y and z but could not make a meaningful
impact on them" sounds
better than "x and I never got along, I had 8 bosses, we had a horrible legacy
codebase, and it was impossible to get anything done with all the meetings."

Sometimes it's possible to address the reasons that drove you to look for
another job. If you're already looking, it may be too late to fix them for
yourself but it's worthwhile to try to fix them, even in your last few weeks at
the company. It may make the work environment better for your colleagues that
stay behind.

### Do something that demonstrates your passion

Interviewers love to see that you have an interest in tech beyond your
day-to-day work. For some, this means getting involved in the open source
community or open sourcing a project of your own on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). For others, it means writing a blog (like this
one!). Overall, I would consider this a nice to have.


Interview Preparation
----------------------

As you prepare your application, it's a good idea to start preparing for the
interviews that will follow. Here's some areas too focus on:

### Study datastructures and algorithms

Unfortunately, algorithms still play a large part in the tech interview process.
As an industry, we [haven't figured
out](http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/) how to determine
who will excel, so interviewers use algorithms as a proxy to test how you think
and communicate.

Understanding the most common data structures and when you might use them will
help you find the solution for many algorithm questions. If you pick
the right one, it can make certain questions easy.

I've used these resources to prepare:

* **[Cracking the Coding Interview][cct]**: A great review of data structures with
  examples of algorithmic questions you might encounter. I think that
  reviewing this is one of the best uses of prep time, especially if you have an
  interview coming up soon.
* **[Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)**: Big O notation is
  a way to talk about how long it will take an algorithm to run. Interviewers
  may ask you about the efficiency of the algorithm you implement and Big O can
  be a good way to communicate your understanding of efficiency.
* **[The Technical Interview Cheat
  Sheet](https://gist.github.com/TSiege/cbb0507082bb18ff7e4b)**: Another list of
  common data structures and algorithms with information about them. If it's
  been a few years since you completed Computer Science coursework, this may help
  refresh your memory.

If you have more time, I recommend Coursera's [Algorithms: Design and
Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) course as well. It's an online
course, so it's more of a commitment.

### Practice problems

When you practice, try to practice in an environment as close as possible to the
one you'll be in in the interview. In general:

1. Write your solution on a whiteboard or piece of paper first without looking
   anything up.
2. Walk through the solution manually and look for errors.
3. When you're confident your answer, type and run the code on a computer.

Many websites offer practice problems. I've used the following:

* **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)**: A collection of free
  math-based programming problems.
* **[Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/)**: A set of cryptography-based problems
  that does not assume prior crypto knowledge. It's a nice way to practice
  because it also gives you some insight into cryptography.
* **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**: More online problems.

If you picked up Cracking the Coding Interview, it has practice problems in it
too. It can take a while to work through even one problem, so don't feel bad
if you don't complete all the exercises. I've never done more than 5-10
exercises in any one of these.

# Interviews

Tech interviews usually don't vary much from place to place.
Here's the most common process I've seen:

1. Phone screen with recruiter (45 minutes)
2. Technical phone screen (45 minutes to 1 hour)
3. On-site technical interview (3 to 6 hours)
4. On-site culture fit interview (2 to 3 hours) - less common
5. Offer / negotiation
7. Profit?

## General Advice

### Interviewing goes both ways

You want to get a feel for if the company will be a good fit for you as much as
the company wants to figure out if you'll work out there. It's easy to forget
that it's bi-directional and worry about whether or not you'll impress them.
Even big name companies may not be a good fit for you personally, so it's good
to suss out whether or not you'd like it there.

### Use a calendar for scheduling

You may have a few phone screens and on-site technical interviews ahead of you.
It's tough to keep all the dates in your head. I scheduled one
hour blocks for technical phone screens and longer blocks for on-site technical
interviews or culture fit interviews on Google Calendar.

If you have to schedule phone interviews and you're still employed, I recommend
suggesting lunch time slots. Some companies will let you interview before or
after traditional work hours but that's less common.

### Bring a notebook

I liked keeping a small notebook and pen with me throughout the interview
process. It's helpful to refer back to things they've said to you and
it's easy to forget details about companies if you don't write them down.
It's a good idea to write down the name of your interviewers too so you can use
their names.

### It won't always work out

There will probably be a few places you interview that aren't a good fit for
you. That's alright.

On the other side, there may be companies that don't think you're the right fit
for them. That is okay too. If you get turned down for a position that you
really wanted, you could always wait and reapply in 6 months.

### Keep an eye out for red flags

Everyone has a different set of red flags. Here's a few things that have
been red flags for me:

* "We have no work-life balance. We come in at 6 AM and leave at 10 PM."

Good that they're being honest with me but the way it's presented makes it sound
like they're proud of it. If they're being this upfront about the workload, it's
likely that it's even worse in practice and they won't probably feel bad about
it because they gave me a warning during the interview

Working that much will drive you to burnout and [adding more time to the workday
does not make you more
productive](http://www.alternet.org/story/154518/why_we_have_to_go_back_to_a_40-hour_work_week_to_keep_our_sanity).


* "Our team is super green and doesn't know what they're doing. I look at
  everything they commit and approve it."

This does not sound like an environment built on trust and distributed
responsibility. Also, if the manager does not have faith in their team and would
badmouth them in an interview, it's not a good sign.

* Untrustworthy

I interviewed with $BIG_TECH_CO in San Francisco. A department manager contacted
me for an interview and said that they allowed for full time remote work. I said
"Great!" and we discussed next steps.

I did the phone interview with them and it went well. The
next day I got a phone call from the recruiter who was handling the process:

>**Recruiter**: "We'd like to schedule you an on-site interview. Oh, but just
checking, you can relocate to SF right?"
>
>**Me**: "When the manager contacted me, he said this could be remote."
>
>**Recruiter**: "Ok. I checked with him and we'll need you up here for about 4 months
so you can get ramped up. You can work remotely after that."

That's no longer full-time remote... but okay... I can make it work.

I went up for the on-site interview and thought it went great. Next day, I got
a phone call from the recruiter again.

>**Recruiter**: "We'd like to extend you an
offer but we'd need you to be up here for 6-9 months to ramp up and
we're just not built for that. We'd need you to relocate."
>
>**Me**: That's too bad. I'll have to turn it down, then.
>
> **Recruiter**: Are you sure? This could really change your life. Why don't you
think about it until Monday?
>
> **Me** (later):  I have been up front with you that
I wanted to do remote work from the beginning so I am not interested.

Their actions gave me insight into what it could be like to work for them. If
they're not honest or up-front with me during the interview process, what
would it be like to be there full time? What other expectations would they have?

## Research

Part of the interview process involves doing a little research.

### Research the company

I like to ratchet up the amount of research I do on companies as interviews
progress. This is what I do for each stage, depending on the company:

* Initial phone calls: Reviewing the website and figuring out what
they do feels like enough to get by.
* Phone screens: I typically read
their blog posts and read through their reviews.
* On-site interviews: I
like to read up on any recent news stories that have come out about the company
and research talks their employees have done.

This approach allows you to get a good understanding of what they do without
requiring too much up-front investment in one individual company. As the number
of companies you apply to goes up, it becomes important to prioritize how you
spend your job search time.

### Research your interviewers

If you know who will interview you, it can help to learn
more about them ahead of time. Do they have open source
projects? Have they given conference talks? If so, have they been recorded?

Learning about the things that interest them allows you to prepare more specific
questions and shows that you're interested. I have once or twice followed
someone I'm interviewing on Twitter.

You can definitely go too far with this, especially if it drifts into stalking
on their social media profiles, so aim for enough so that you can prepare.

### Prepare questions to ask

I once had a phone interview that started at 7 PM. The interviewer called me and
said "Hello! I don't want to waste your time, what questions do you have for
me?"

Although I think that's a terrible approach to interviewing, that kind of thing
can happen. Hopefully your earlier research should make this one easy.
I like to write down both the questions and the answers I hear in response.

General questions include:

* What's an average work week like?
* How is the software team organized?
* What process does a feature follow from idea to delivery?
* What's one of your favorite things about working at the company?
* What would you like to change?


## Phone Interviews

The phone interview typically does not involve coding because of the tricky
mechanics of coding over the phone. It will probably take about an hour overall.
Typically, the interviewer wants to see if you would be a good fit for the
position and your comfort with their technology stack.

The questions typically skew to the softer end. Examples include:

* Tell me about yourself
* What project are you most proud of? Why?
* What interests you about the position?

Sometimes for the technical phone screens you'll get more challenging questions,
such as [what happens when](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) you type
 `https://www.<company>.com` in your browser?

### Find a comfortable place to talk

You could be on the phone for an hour or so. I'd
recommend finding a good, comfortable place to do that.
It's important to pick somewhere that will

* Be quiet.
* Let you focus.

Your spot could be parked on a street near work or at your kitchen table.
There's nothing worse than constantly worrying if you'll get caught on a phone
screen, so it's helpful to pick a secluded place.

I once left my keys in my car and my car wouldn't start after the interview when
I had to return to work, so probably don't do that.

### Recruiters are not your friends

Recruiters can be friendly and helpful. They want you to find a job that
you'll enjoy. That said, you are a paycheck for them if you're
placed with the company they represent so they may be aggressive or try for the
hard sell.
Keep in mind that this, like all things, is a two way street.

One example. I talked with a recruiter and the company he represented wanted
to move forward. I said I'd like time to think about it and I would email
him back that evening. He told me not to waste his time or lie to him.

A friend of mine negotiated his contract with a recruiter and they promised
things to him that they had no control over. For example, they said they would
re-evaluate his salary in a few months but that didn't happen because he had no
influence on when that happened.

Recruiters want to help you and I've found jobs through recruiters but be
careful out there.

### If you must give a salary range, anchor high

Early in the process, your interviewer will try to get you to offer a salary
range. Avoid it if you can. We'll talk about negotiating in more detail
later in this post.

I haven't been able to avoid offering a salary range to recruiters on the phone.
It's worth asking for what you want or a little more so you'll have room to
negotiate down the line. We'll cover negotiating in more detail later.

If you've
already discussed salary with the company earlier in the process and they
exceeded it, it could be in bad faith to negotiate for a higher number. "Oh
actually I decided I want more than I told you." That's one reason
why people anchor with higher numbers earlier in the process
so that they have room to negotiate for other things.



## On-site Interviews

On-site interviews take about 3-6 hours, depending on the company. In
my experience, they tend to be with groups of 1-3 people and you meet with a few
groups. Some companies, like Uber and Google, do a series of one-on-one
interviews while others prefer small groups.

Generally interviews open with questions to about your experiences, like
the questions we've covered in earlier sections. After that, the interviewer
will likely ask more questions to get you comfortable.  Sometimes they will be
questions about project you've worked on, side projects, or personal interests.

You can expect a few different algorithmic questions. Interviewers will often
tailor questions based on your resume or they may have a fixed set of problems
they like to ask. On the other side, you may be asked scenario questions.
We'll cover both of those in more detail.

### Tips for algorithm questions

Example of an algorithmic question:
"How would you store all the phone numbers in the phone book?"
[TODO, revisit]

**Ask clarifying questions.** There's a famous question about sorting a list of
1 million integers. The question notably does not include the fact that the
numbers represent birthdays, so you can sort the integers into at most 150
buckets. If you ask questions, you might get a shortcut like that.
It's almost always better to ask or suppose than to assume.

**Think out loud.** It's tempting to work through problems in your head,
especially if that's how you'd normally work. Unfortunately, that can work
against you in a coding interview. By explaining your thought process, even when
you're stuck, you give the interviewer a view into how you work and an
opportunity to help you out.

**Solve it with pseudocode first.** Thinking through how you would approach the
problem without the constraints of writing syntactically correct code makes it
much easier. If you choose to do this, it's a good idea to explain that you'll
write pseudocode first and write the implementation afterward.
It's also okay to solve it by brute-force as long as you explain that it's not
your final solution.

**Consider efficiency.** Think through different data structures you might use
and the trade-offs for each. When would you use a dictionary / hash map? When
would you want to use a queue?

**Write tests as you go.** It's a good idea to write tests that will verify that
your solution works so you can trace through your solution if you get stuck.
It also shows that you like writing tests, which I think is a big plus.

**Check for mistakes.** When you feel like you're done, trace through your
solution and look for any mistakes or areas where it would fall apart. Did you
miss an edge case? What happens if the list is empty? How might it fall apart in
production?


### Tips for a Scenario Question

Example of a scenario question:
"How would you architect an upload workflow for a SaaS application?"

It's more important to explain your approach and the technical implications of
your implementation than to design code for scenario questions.

For example, for the above question you might want to think about how the user
will interact with the server, what kind of HTTP operation they'd do to what
example endpoint, how to handle background processing for any files that are
uploaded, and what steps you'd take to prevent things from going wrong.

### It's okay if you don't know the answer right away

Interviewers want to test you with the technical questions and there's no
expectation that you'll solve it quickly.

The interviewer may want to see how you perform under pressure. Take your time
and work through it a bit at a time. No one expects that you'll know the answer
right away. They want to see your process and if they can work with you to get
to the answer.

## Offers

### You don't have to move forward

If you get an offer, it does not mean you have to take it. Over the course of
the interview, you may have found that it's not a good fit. Let the company know
as soon as you do if you don't think it's for you so you can save each other's
time.

### If you're offered equity, determine its worth

The short version: Your options probably will be worth $0, so it might be
easiest to ignore them.

If you're looking for numbers, there are many resources you could consult.
I think [this guide](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation) is the
easiest to understand. Beyond that, there's also a number of entertaining and
informative articles such as:

* [How to value your startup stock
  options](http://robertheaton.com/2015/11/02/how-to-value-your-startup-stock-options/)
* [Things you should know about stock
  options](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/12/30/do-the-math-on-your-stock-options/)

### Always negotiate

Patrick Kalzumeus wrote an excellent and popular article on [how to
negotiate](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)
It's worth the time to read it.

Don't feel bad about negotiating - it's what you're supposed to do.

If you're happy with the salary they offer, you could negotiate other aspects.
For example, would you like to take classes outside of work that they could
reimburse you for? What about vacation days? Would you like to attend
a conference later in the year? Perhaps you'd like to work from home for a day
or two a week. You may be able to negotiate these things.
