Advice for a Technical Job Search
------

I just recently completed a job hunt and wound up at ChowNow. As I was going
through the process, I realized that there's a lot of steps and many bits that
can go wrong. I think there's some advice I can share about mindset and finding
a good opportunity that works for you.


## Personal Stats

I wound up applying to about 25 places this time, had phone interviews with 9,
and on-site technical interviews with 6. Most of those would have progressed to
offers but I turned most of them down for various reasons.

I've also helped interview around 20 technical candidates and 30 interns in
previous positions, so I have some experience on the other side of the table as
well.

I offer these only as background and reference. I have a background in the film
industry where I would sometimes send out 100+ applications for a single job, so
these hit rates are comparatively much higher. It's one of the many nice things
about working in tech that's easy to take for granted.

## Finding Jobs

3. Look at job postings

There's a large number of places where you can find job postings. I think
there's something to the ["the best jobs aren't
advertised"](http://www.careershifters.org/expert-advice/why-the-best-jobs-are-never-advertised-and-how-to-find-them)
but networking kind of sucks too so sometimes it's nice to see what's out there.
I think we also have a leg-up in tech. Most tech companies are constantly in
hiring mode so they leave job postings up all the time even they're not actively
searching because of the possibility of missing out on an excellent candidate.

Note, these are non-exhaustive lists.

Some examples of places I've used to look for jobs:

* [Hacker News - Who's Hiring?](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring)
  - Posted on the first of every month. A good list of companies along
  with their region. If a company is posting on Hacker News, it's
  more likely that I would want to work for them because it means that they're
  active in the community. 
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm) - Even if you don't use
  their jobs page, Glassdoor reviews can provide an excellent and easy way to
  see what other employees have said about working there. Be sure to carefully
  read any reviews that have been posted for the positives and negatives.
* [Angel List](https://angel.co/) - Mostly for startups. I had a few
  applications through here and didn't find anything that was a good fit.
* [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) - Pretty good
  overall. I don't really understand why you have to make a careers page for
  yourself and then it doesn't use that for any of the applications. 
* [Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com) - A startup that interviews you and then
  will fast-track you to YCombinator startups. Right now, the fast track is
  basically a way to bypass the steps up to the technical phone screen so it
  doesn't actually buy you much time. Still, it's good to get practice with
  technical interviews and this was one of the more challenging technical
  interviews I went through.

If you want to work remotely:

* [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
* [Working Nomads](http://www.workingnomads.co/jobs)
* [Remotive](http://remotive.io/)
* [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/)

I've never applied through Monster or Dice so I can't speak to those.


3. Make a list of companies you would like to work for / products you use and
   like

Sometimes I think this one is easy to skip. I live in Los Angeles, so we don't
have quite the same breadth of places that we can apply as those in Silicon
Valley. As such, it's easy to assume that some of the companies I'd be
interested in don't have a presence in my area. That said, most of the larger
companies do have a branch down in Los Angeles area. After making a list
of companies you'd like to work for, you may be surprised by how many of them
are options in an area near you. For example, in LA, there's Google, Microsoft,
Snapchat, Tindr, and a number of other larger tech companies. After making
the list, you may find more options than you thought!


4. Configure LinkedIn to work for you

First, you'll probably want to turn off any notifications of your activity.
If you make a bunch of changes to your job description or the place that you 
live and it's broadcasted to your coworkers, you're gonna have a bad time.

https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/78/~/showing-or-hiding-activity-updates-about-you

Then, if you're looking to move somewhere, set your locale to the place you'd
like to move. I've worked with someone that did this to great success. They
lived in Michigan at the time but wanted to move to Los Angeles. Changing their
locale got more recruiters interested in them. He mentioned during his
interviews that he lived in Michigan but he wanted to move and would be happy to
do so. It's a great way to get extra recruiter attention if you're looking for
it.


5. Attend local meetups

[Local Meetup Groups](http://www.meetup.com/)

Whatever your interest in tech, there's probably a meetup group for it. 
I think that attending local meetups has a number of positives if you're 
getting ready for a job hunt. 

For one, it's a great way to find other places to apply. I find that the
companies that host meetup events are more likely to be ones that I would want
to work at because it shows that they care about the community (even if only to
find candidates) and want to foster an engineering culture. Those are both
important!

For another, you can talk with other developers in your community, which has all
sorts of benefits. They might have a different perspective on some technical
topics you're interested in (such as code reviews or security), or they may be
able to offer you a view into what it's like at their company. 

For yet another, you'll probably get to learn about some interesting
developments in your field, which gives you something to talk about in
interviews.

Finally, if you're interested in speaking, meetups are a great way to practice
slides before submitting them to a conference. Speaking at meetups also offers
a way to feel like you're an expert at something and develop a deeper knowledge
on a topic. If you're practicing on that topic, it's a good chance you'll feel 
comfortable talking about it during an interview later. 


## Application Preparation

1. Update your resume

You'll probably want to tune your resume more specifically to what you want to
do. Try to keep it short and full of active sentences without much fluff.
[This
article](https://www.asme.org/career-education/articles/job-hunting/6-tips-for-writing-an-effective-resume)
has a pretty good set of recommendations in it. Feel free to send it my way too
and I'll be happy to offer some opinions.

2. I hate cover letters

I pretty much don't bother with cover letters if I can help it. In this past
group of applications, I put together cover letters for about 5 different places
and none of them contacted me back.

1. Keep a spreadsheet to track where you apply

I kept a Google Spreadsheet with a list of the places I had applied, 
a bit about the position, dates for the various steps I completed, and any
notes or thoughts I had as I went through them. Sometimes it's challenging
to keep dates straight.


2. Keep a positive attitude

It can take a while to find a job that's a good fit for you and it's important
to keep a good attitude.

I was looking for apartments with my girlfriend and we looked for a long time.
We had a fixed price range and a firm idea of where we wanted to live, but the
places we kept finding were dumpy, small, or "not for the, shall we say,
culinary inclined" (aka a hotplate and a mini-fridge made up the kitchen).  In
our case, we wound up looking at around 30 places until we found one that we
wanted. When we finally did, we had one last appointment scheduled afterward.
When we looked at it, we knew it was for us.

It's really tempting to want to give up. Stick with it and do your best to keep
a good attitude. I find meditation helpful for avoiding frustration when I feel
particularly down. It's always hard looking for a new job and we have
the great fortune of being in an industry that's in-demand.

2. Plan on applying and interviewing at more than one place

I have a friend that took the first interview he was offered and then accepted
the job. It's working out great for him but he also says that he wishes he had
applied to more places. For one, it gives you a better understanding of what's
out there and prevents you from fixating on a single company.

You can apply the Secretary Problem.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem

Basically, you'll interview at the first third of the places you'd expect to
interview at in general and then take the next job that is better than all the
ones you've taken so far.


3. Determine your salary range

How do you do this? 

Glassdoor is probably your biggest ally. Do a quick search
at the particular company you're investigating or you can do a broader search
for the region. To some extent, the numbers may be out of date because they're
historical and they'll change over time. It should give you a pretty good idea
of what the market's like where you live though. There's also 
[some excellent](https://www.roberthalf.com/sites/default/files/Media_Root/images/rht-pdfs/robert_half_technology_2016_salary_guide.pdf)
[salary guides](http://get.hired.com/rs/348-IPO-044/images/Hired-State-of-Salaries.pdf)
for those in technical fields, so those should help you figure out some numbers
too. 


4. Think about why you're leaving and what you want from your next job

You'll probably be asked some combination of the following two questions at
every interview:

* Why are you leaving?
* What are you looking for on your new team?

Be careful when talking about reasons why you're leaving. Definitely don't
badmouth the company you're at. There's ways to say what you're feeling without
it sounding negative.

Sometimes the reasons why you're thinking about leaving can be fixed. I'd
recommend trying (if you haven't) to affect change, even in your last few weeks
in the position.


6. Do something that demonstrates your passion

Interviewers love to see that you have an interest in programming beyond the
day-to-day work that you do at your job. For some people, this means getting
involved in the open source community or open sourcing a project of your own on
[GitHub](https://github.com/). For others, it means writing a blog (like this
one!). I'd consider this a "nice to have" but it is valuable to be able to
show that you're invested in what you and you care.


## Interview Preparation

4. Study datastructures and algorithms

Unfortunately, this is still a major part of the process. As an industry, we
[haven't figured out](http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/)
how to find people who will excel at the job, so algorithms are used as a proxy
to test your problem-solving skills.

* [Cracking the Coding Interview][cct] - A great review of data structures and
  some examples of algorithmic questions you might encounter. I think that
  re-reading the book is one of the best uses of time, especially if you have an
  interview coming up on short notice. I've used this one for different job
  interviews.

Data structures are pretty much the key to most algorithm questions, so long as
you know the right ones to pick. Some are legitimately algorithms that you just
have to know, but less likely.

http://bigocheatsheet.com/


I would not recommend trying to cram all your algorithm practice in at once. You
probably won't have a good time doing it and you're more likely to retain the
knowledge if you [study each
day](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html) rather than fit
it all in at once.

If you have more time, I've gone through Coursera's [Algorithms: Design and
Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) course and found it useful for
getting started with algorithms.

3. Practice some problems

When you practice, try to practice in an environment as close as possible to the
one you'll be in in the interview. So, in general:

1. Write your solution on a whiteboard / piece of paper first without looking
   anything up.
2. Check

Here's some canonical recommendations that I've looked at in preparation:

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - A collection of free mathematical
  / programming questions. 

* http://cryptopals.com/
* https://github.com/codingforinterviews/practice-problems



1. Use a Calendar to keep track of your interviews

Depending on how aggressive your job search, you may have quite a few 
phone screens and on-site technical interviews ahead of you. It's tough to keep
all the dates in your head. Use a calendar! I would schedule one hour blocks
for technical phone screens and a longer block for on-site technical interviews
or culture fit interviews.

If you're scheduling phone screens and you are still employed, I find that lunch
breaks are good times to do phone screens. Some places are flexible and will let
you interview before / after traditional work hours but it can be hard to
find do that. 


2. Research the company

I like to ratchet up the amount of research I do on companies as interviews
progress. For recruiter phone calls, sometimes reading the website and figuring
out what they do is enough to get by. For phone screens, I'll typically read
blog posts they or their employees have done about working at the company. For
on site interviews, I also like to read up on any recent news stories that have
come out about the company and research talks that they've done.

The graduated approach toward learning more about the company allows you to get
a good understanding of what they do without requiring too much up-front
investment in one individual company. As the number of companies you apply to
goes up, the ways in which you invest your job search time become more important
to prioritize.

2. Research your interviewers


If you know who you'll be speaking with for interviews, it can help to learn
ahead of time what area they specialize in. Do they have an open source
presence? Have they given talks at a conference that have been recorded?
Learning a bit about the things that interest them allows you to prepare more
specific questions to them and shows that you have an interest in the people
you're meeting. I have once or twice followed someone I'm interviewing on
Twitter.

Note, you can definitely go too far with this. I probably wouldn't go to
personal social media or try to dredge up Reddit profiles or something. Try to
just get a broad overview of what they're like so you can prepare.

4. Prepare questions to ask

I once had a phone interview that started at 7 PM. The interviewer called me
and said "I don't want to waste your time, what questions do you have for me?"
Although I think that's overall a terrible approach to interviewing a candidate,
that kind of thing does happen. More frequently, the interview is an opportunity
for you to get insight into what it's like to work there and what they're
working on. Hopefully your earlier research should make this one easy.

I like to write down both the questions and the answers they give. 

Some other, less company-specific, questions include things like:

* What's an average work week like?
* How is the software team organized?
* What process does a new feature follow from conception to delivery?
* What's one of your favorite things about working at the company? What would
  you like to change?


# Interviews

## Process

3. Phone screen with recruiter (45 minutes)
4. Technical phone screen (45 minutes to 1 hour)
5. On-site technical interview (3 to 6 hours)
6. On-site culture fit interview (2 to 3 hours)
7. Offer
8. Profit?

## General Advice

1. You're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you.

This is an easy one to forget because I think there's a lot of emphasis on
impressing the interviewer.

Try to keep in mind that you're getting a feel for if the company is a good fit
for you as much as they are. Ask questions about what it's like there on a day
to day. 

2. Take notes

I liked keeping a small notebook and pen with me throughout the interview
process for each company. It's helpful to be able to refer back to things
they've said to you and it's easy to forget details about companies if you're
not writing it down as you go. Sometimes I've found it helpful to record
examples of what their workweek was like, how it is to work there, general
stack, general problems. Writing down the name of the interviewer is incredibly
valuable as it allows you to use their name when you talk with them.

3. It won't always work out

There will probably be a few places you interview that aren't as good as you
thought they sounded on paper. That's alright.

On the other side, there may be companies that don't think you're the right fit
for them. That too is okay. If you get turned down for a position and you had
your heart set on that particular place, you could always wait and reapply in
6 months. 

4. Admit when you don't know

Interviewers will sometimes ask you how to do something, and you may not know
the answer. In that case, it's fine to say that you don't know the answer. You
should probably explain your thought process "Well, I know that this does x and
that does y, but I'm not sure what x and y would do together. Perhaps it would
do z?"

5. Keep an eye out for red flags

Everyone has a different set of red flags. Here's a few things that have
been red flags for me:

* "We have no work-life balance. We come in at 6 AM and leave at 10 PM."

Good that they're being honest with me but the way it's presented makes it
sound like they're proud of it. If they're being this level of upfront about the
workload, it's probable that it's even worse in practice and they won't probably
feel bad about it because they warned me.

Also, that amount of work is unsafe and will drive you crazy.

http://www.businessinsider.com/working-more-than-40-hours-a-week-is-useless-2012-3

* "Our team is super green. We have four people do code reviews for everything
    because they don't know what they're doing."

Whoa, four people review every bit of code? Perhaps that's okay if you work at
NASA or JPL and you're doing safety critical work. For most stuff, it makes me
feel like it's probably an environment that does not lend itself to trust.

Also, if this person does not have faith in the team and would badmouth them in
an interview, that does not bode well.

* Dishonesty

I interviewed with $BIG_TECH_CO in SF. A department manager contacted me for an
interview and said that they would allow for remote work. I said "Great!" and we
discussed next steps. 

I did the phone interview with them and it went well. The
next day I got a phone call from the recruiter who was handling the process and
she said "We'd like to schedule you for an on-site interview. Oh, but just
checking, you can relocate to San Francisco right?" When I said "No, we said
this would be remote" it changed to "Ok, we'll need you up here for 4 months so
we can get you ramped up and then you can be full time remote." Well, that's not
full-time remote... but okay...

I went up for the on-site interview and thought it went great. Next day, I got
a phone call from the recruiter again and she said "We'd like to extend you an
offer but we'd need you to be up here for 6-9 months to ramp up and
we're just not built for that so we'd need you to relocate." 

I had to turn it down because I had expressed interest in full-time remote work
from the beginning. Their actions gave me insight into what it could be like to
work for them. If they're not being honest or up-front with me during the
interview process, what would it be like to be there full time? What other
expectations would they have of me? 

* Asshole Interviewers

Sometimes you'll meet someone that's just an asshole in an interview. It's
probably a red flag if they're going to be that way in an interview. Hopefully
they're in a department far away from yours but, if not, it's probably not worth
it. I find interviews to be nerve wracking so having someone be cruel when you're
in a position of vulnerability is not cool.


## Phone Interviews

Describe overall phone interviews, what they're looking for, typical questions

2. Find a comfortable place to talk

If you're doing a phone screen, you could be on the phone for an hour or so. I'd
recommend finding a good, comfortable place to do that. It might be parked
somewhere nearby work or it could be a coffee shop that you know will be quiet.
It's important to pick somewhere that will 

a. Be quiet.
b. Let you focus

There's nothing worse than constantly worrying if you'll get caught on a phone
screen, so picking a place that's somewhat secluded is helpful.

3. Recruiters are not your friends

Some recruiters will be friendly and helpful. They want you to find a job you'll
like and be happy at. That said, they want to place you with companies so they
will sometimes be aggressive or try to sell you hard on a place. Keep in mind
that this, like all things, is a two way street.

One example. I was talking with a recruiter this time and they wanted to move
forward. I wanted to think about it and said I'd email them back later. He said
it was bullshit and told me not to waste his time or lie to him. I would have
emailed him honestly with my opinion but felt pressured and shamed, even though
I was being honest.

Recruiters will also sometimes pose as employees / managers internal to the
company. Sometimes this is true. Sometimes it's not. Just be careful if they
make promises such as re-evaluating your salary in x months, because they may
not have any impact on that process.

4. Anchor high if you must give a salary range

I haven't been able to avoid giving a salary range to recruiters on the phone.
It's worth asking for what you want or a little more so you'll have room to
negotiate down the line. We'll cover negotiating in more detail later.


## On-site Interviews

On-site interviews typically span from about 3-6 hours, depending on the
company. In my experience, they're typically with groups of 1-3 people and
you'll probably meet up with a few different groups. Some companies, like Uber
and Google, typically do a series of one-on-one interviews while others do the
small groups. 

Generally interviews will open with some questions to
hear about your experiences. Almost always the first item will be "Tell me
about yourself." It can be hard to give a thumbnail sketch of your life but...
do your best.

After that, there's usually some questions to get you feeling comfortable.
Sometimes they will be questions about project you've worked on, side projects,
or personal interests. Sometimes you'll talk about the reasons why you're
leaving your last place or looking for a new one.

You can expect a few different algorithmic questions. My guess is that the
questions will either be tailored to items that you have put on your resume or
items that are somewhat related to the job. Sometimes you'll get "scenario"
questions.


* Tips for an Algorithm question

Example of an algorithmic question:
"How would you store all the phone numbers in the phone book? Write out the code
you'd use to do so."

Ask clarifying questions. There's a famous question about sorting a list of
1 million integers. The bit of information that's left out is that the integers
represent birthdays, so you can sort the integers into at most 150 buckets
rather than doing a slower, less efficient sorting method. If you ask what they
represent, you might get a shortcut like that. It's almost always better to ask
or suppose than to assume.

During coding interviews, it's tempting to work out how to solve the problems in
your head. I'd suggest avoiding that instinct. One of the biggest favors you can
do for yourself is thinking out loud. By saying your thoughts and explaining
where you're at in a problem, even if you're stuck, you give the interviewer an
opportunity to help you out.

Using something in your language's standard library might not be allowed, but
you can mention that you might use it. 

Think through different data structures you might use and the trade-offs for
each. When would you use a dictionary / hash map? When would you want to use
a queue?

It's okay to solve it with psuedocode first as long as you explain that that's
what you're doing and that you'll revisit it later.

It's also okay to solve it in a brute-force style at first. You can always
revisit, again as long as you're explaining that you're doing the brute force
approach. Think out loud, remember?

If you're doing a code challenge, write tests as you go. 


* Tips for a Scenario Question

Example of a scenario question:
"How would you architect an upload workflow for a SaaS application?"

Depending on the interviewer, it could be less important to implement low-level
code for this as much as it would be to walk through your approach to solving
the problem. Typically for this level (again, depending on the interviewer),
you'll want to do broader strokes. 

For example, for the above question you might want to think about how the user
will interact with the server, what kind of HTTP operation they'd do to what
example endpoint, how to handle background processing for any files that are
uploaded, and what steps you'd take to prevent things from going wrong.


4. If they offer water, take it.

Something to do if nervous. Easy to get dehydrated over the course of the day.

6. It's okay if you don't know the answer right away

Interviewers want to see what your thought process is like, so if you know the
answer immediately it's like doing a math problem without showing your work. 

Interviewers usually want to stump you with the technical questions, so it's
okay to not know the answer. Sometimes they'll want to see how you are under
pressure. I worked in the past with some people who, if I was being kind during
the interview, would compensate by being aggressive to see how the interviewee
was under pressure. In one case, that led to someone slamming a glass cup
repeatedly and getting obviously mad. I don't like that this happens, I think we
should be kind to everyone, but it does. So, keep your cool if you can. It's not
expected that you'll know the answer but rather they want to see your process of
getting to an answer and see if they can work with you to find the answer.

## Offers

1. If you're offered equity, find out how it's worth

http://robertheaton.com/2015/11/02/how-to-value-your-startup-stock-options/
http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/12/30/do-the-math-on-your-stock-options/
http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/09/06/how-to-discuss-stock-options-with-your-team/

The short version? Your options probably will be worth $0, so might be better to
ignore them completely in the negotiation process.


2. Negotiate as a rule

Patrick Kalzumeus http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

Hopefully you've already established a salary range that you'd be looking at in
one of the earlier steps. What would it take for you to be happy there for
a while? 

Don't feel bad about negotiating - this is what you're supposed to do.
If you don't negotiate, you could be leaving considerable money on the table.
Patrick talks about this in his article but it is true. 

If you've already discussed salary with them earlier in the process and they
exceeded it, it could be bad faith to discuss other numbers. That's one reason
why people will sometimes anchor with much higher numbers earlier in the process
so that they have room to negotiate for other things.

If salary's already great, maybe there are other things you could negotiate.
For example, are you taking classes outside of work that they could reimburse
you for? What about vacation days? Perhaps you'd like to attend a conference
later in the year? These things can be discussed at this point for sure.

3. Ask for more than you're comfortable with

I've had a few experiences negotiating that have stuck with me.

PCI

3. Don't feel pressured to take the offer

Don't feel pressured to take the first job offer that comes along. Sometimes
the first one that you get is the perfect one for you. If so, great! 

If not, it's okay. Sometimes over the course of the interviews you may find that
the company's not a good fit for you in particular and that you shoudl turn it
down. That's alright.
