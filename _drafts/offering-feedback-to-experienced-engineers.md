title: Offering Feedback to Experienced Engineers

I had a one-on-one discussion some time ago with a colleague who joined
a new company and well-established team. During design and code reviews, they
felt uneasy offering feedback to the experienced engineers and second-guessed
themselves. What feedback could they offer to a team that knows
what they're doing? Haven't the experienced engineers already considered any
points they might bring up?

I think this experience is common! I've joined new teams and didn't know what
I could offer too. In this post, we'll explore what's behind the discomfort and
ways to overcome it.


## Understanding

Let's first attempt to look behind this feeling and see what might be at root.

### Impostor Syndrome
Feeling like we don't know anything
I wrote [another blog post on Imposter Syndrome](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/27/impostor-syndrome-and-me) (gosh, has it been 7 years already?) and it still comes up for me!

### Venn Diagram Knowledge
What we know vs what others know may not overlap


## Overcoming
My biggest advice here is ask questions.

### Ask Open-Ended Questions
* Avoid Yes/No questions
* Avoid "Whys". E.g. instead of "Why did you do X?", "What led you to choose X approach over Y?".

### Explore / Learn

* Questions can expose gaps
* Admit when you don't know something
* Apply Baby-Mind

For example, in code reviews, I sometimes use a technique I think of as "baby
mind", where I'll purposefully not devote too much deep thought into a CR.

### Be Kind to Future-You
In 6 months, will what's under review still make sense? If not, it's a great
opportunity to explore cleaning it up or making it easier to understand now.

### Feedback as Growth

Something I find helpful is changing how I think about feedback and its role.

In [Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-English-Bhante-Henepola-Gunaratana/dp/0861719069/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), there's a section that comes to mind:

> We all have blind spots. The other person is our
mirror for us to see our faults with wisdom. We should consider the person who
shows our shortcomings as one who excavates a hidden treasure in us that we were
unaware of. It is by knowing the existence of our deficiencies that we can
improve ourselves. . . . Before we try to surmount
our defects, we should know what they are.

> . . . If we are blind to our own flaws, we need someone to point
them out to us. When they point out our faults, we should be grateful to them
like the Venerable Sariputta, who said: "Even if a seven-year-old novice monk
points out my mistakes, I will accept them with utmost respect for him."

I think about this a lot! As an engineer with some experience, I'm grateful for
all the feedback I've received over time and credit it with a lot of our growth.

Even though it's uncomfortable to offer feedback to engineers with more experience,
ultimately it is the best way for us to grow and get better.

The book goes on to say:

> Of course the person pointing out our mistakes himself may not be totally free
from defects, but he can see our problems as we can see his faults, which he
does not notice until we point them out to him.

> Both pointing out shortcomings and responding to them should be done mindfully.
