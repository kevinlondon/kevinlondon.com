title: Getting Feedback When You're Established

In [Giving Feedback When You're
New](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2022/02/13/providing-feedback-to-engineers),
I talked about how to calibrate and offer feedback as a new teammate.
What about when you're established? Surely that's easier right? Maybe!
While you may gain the benefit of experience, that can now mean a few things:

1. It takes longer to find out when we're wrong
2. People may be more inclined to think you're right even when you're not
3. If someone thinks you're wrong, they may feel less comfortable telling you

So how do we deal with these challenges?

I should preface this by saying I'm not sure I'm in a great spot to provide
feedback on this! I'm still learning too and my transition to a senior engineer
role, at least at Amazon, happened last year and so feels recent. In some
regards, it's still a bit hard to wrap my head around others wanting to hear
what I have to say. Some of what's here is me figuring it out and it seems
likely I'll change my opinion on this over time.

### Dealing with Long Feedback Loops
As we get more experience, the feedback loops get longer, so it can take time to
find out if a project went well. We may have to scratch or scrounge for signs
that a choice we made was the right one. Similarly, if we make a poor decision, it
could be a long time until we see that decision come home to roost!

At Amazon, the engineers on the engineering ladder have focuses something like:

* **SDE I**: Task / features
* **SDE II**: Component / service level with some team-level involvement.
* **Senior Engineer**: Team level with some cross-team involvement.
* **Principal Engineer**: Organization level+

So naturally, as we move up the ladder, these feedback loops are going to
get longer. As a Senior Engineer, maybe we make a decision that doesn't
materialize for 6 months to a year! I'm not at the Principal Engineer level.
I can only imagine what's that's like.

What if we predicted improperly and it won't pan out? We have to be more
cautious as we move up the ladder, because we're more likely to make a decision
that could be challenging to back out of without incurring timeline delays. At
Amazon, these are called ["one-way door
decisions"](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html).

Having a short feedback loop is critical for improving and making the right decisions.

What does this mean in practice? *Find out where you could be wrong while it's cheap!*
It's much cheaper and easier to discover a hole or fault in a plan while it's
still in the planning stage.

* **Coordinate with the stakeholders**. Keeping a close line of communication
  with those most involved in your project or initiative can help course
  correct. For example, perhaps we're taking a dependency on a team to have
  a component ready in 6 months. We need to know if something happened that
  changed timelines. Maybe their roadmap changed and it won't be ready for
  a year now!
* **Seek diverse feedback**. Invite stakeholders and other team members to offer
  what we could be overlooking. Perhaps there's an expert in a particular
  technology you're choosing that you could leverage! (As an aside: if there's
  not a mechanism to review designs,
  perhaps consider starting one or having an open-door policy for discussing
  designs with teammates.)
* **Communicate progress**. Proactive communication has a much higher value at
  higher seniority levels. The work we do may be seen by many, and it's possible
  there will be a wide group that's eagerly looking to see what path you take.
  If it's a pull-based communication, where someone has to ask what you're
  working on and how it's going, that will wind up costing a lot of time and
  have a smaller impact on who we can reach.

This also comes up regularly on the Staff Eng podcast.

### Appearing Right When We're Wrong

#### Overcoming the Halo Effect

#### Lean on Active Listening

#### Acknowledge Mistakes

### Ask for Feedback

#### Stay Present

#### Beware Defensiveness

#### Use the Beginner's Mind

As we gain experience, it becomes increasingly difficult to see the faults in
our thinking and to avoid making blunders. We have to take care to avoid
mistakes because it could take a while for us to see them as such. We need to
work harder at letting others speak and take the lead, and balancing what they
share against our prior conceptions. Lastly, we need to actively request
feedback and acknowledge when we're wrong.

By taking these steps, hopefully it helps us avoid falling into the trappings of
experience and hubris which can come with it, if we're not careful.
