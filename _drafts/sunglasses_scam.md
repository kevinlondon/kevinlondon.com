About 10 years ago, I pulled off one of my favorite scams in a game called
Ragnarok Online. 

About Ragnarok
--------------

Ragnarok Online, if you are not familiar, is an anime-styled MMO game that had
a brief moment of popularity in the US. I think it's more popular in Korea,
where the game is from, as kRO (the Korean Ragnarok Online servers) are the
canonical ones. 

As with most Korean MMOs, it's primary built around killing the 
same monsters until you receive a particular rare item ("grinding").
In Ragnarok's case, the rare item you'd want is usually a hat, some kind of 
facial wear, or a card, which could be inserted into another item.

In the game, you control a figure that walks around and stabs things or casts 
spells. The characters in Ragnarok can be customized in small ways. You can
color your character's armor in a broad sense, you can change your headgear,
or you can change your facial wear. Those are the only visible changes. 
As such, hats and facial wear held positions of great importance to the players.

10 years ago, I played the game with some friends on an unofficial, third-party
server. The server made some changes to parts of the game, such as the item
drop rate and experience, so it felt less "grindy", which
is great when some of the items only dropped with a 0.01% chance from a 
monster. That's not a typo, they genuinely expected you to kill 10k of the
same monster to get an item on the official servers.

In the game, you could sell items to other players using a Vending mode.
You'd put a number of items in your virtual inventory to sell with a set
price and open your store. Usually you'd log off after opening your store
because it could take a long time to sell out an inventory.
There was basically one main store-front in the
game in the main town, Prontera. Everyone lined up to sell their wares. 

I sold mine too, though poorly. I'd frequently load up a full inventory
worth of items, price them competitively, and then
log on the next day to find that nothing had sold. It was rare to clean out
a full inventory over even a period of a week unless you were way under market.

Everything changed when I discovered The Sunglasses.

The Sunglasses Scam
------------------


One day, I listed my usual inventory and, at the bottom, added a pair of plain
old sunglasses that you could buy from a vendor in a distant town. I had picked
up a pair just because I thought they'd be interesting and they only ran
10,000 Zeny (the in-game currency) from the non-player merchant. 
I added them to the bottom of my inventory with the same margin as all 
the other items, so I expected to make a profit of maybe 10-20%. 

The sunglasses sold before I even logged off.

"That's interesting." I said.

I went back to the distant town, picked up another couple of pairs of sunglasses
and listed them a little more expensively. Originally I had listed them
at 8000 Z, so this time I listed them all at 11K Z, which would be about
a 30% profit. I opened my store and logged out.

20 minutes later, I checked my store and found it completely cleaned out again.
I didn't get it. These sunglasses could be purchased an in-game vendor. Why
were people buying them from me at these prices?

I loaded up another inventory full of sunglasses. This time, I wanted to 
experiment. What would happen if I listed them at a higher price?
I opened my store again, this time I sold them for 12K, 13K, 14K, etc, all 
the way up to 20K and opened the store. I got up and went to get a snack.
By the time I came back, again, they were all gone.

Okay, let's see how far we can take this. I opened my store front again and
listed the glasses at prices ranging from 20K to 40K. 

They didn't sell. At least, not at first. This time, it took 2 hours to sell
them out. Of course, the lowest priced glasses sold the quickest, followed
by the next lowest. Eventually, some sad soul purchased the 40K pair. He
probably didn't know that he had missed out on a comparative deal, though.
He was probably still excited by the sunglasses.

I continued like this for a little while. I slowly inched my way up to and over
the 50K Z mark over the next few days. I continued to raise prices and 
show them in a gradiation of pricing. At one point, I sold a pair for 80K Z.

The next day, I logged in and found myself in in-game jail. The game master
had stuck me there as punishment for what he called scamming. If I continued,
he said, I would be banned permanently. Instead, I was stuck in in-game jail
for about 3 hours. 

I still feel it's not quite scamming so much as the advantage of having
additional information.  Perhaps I knew that these were sold in another city and
other players did not.  Maybe they thought they were buying the more expensive
cousin of the plain sunglasses, the slotted sunglasses. Either way, I never
sold another pair of sunglasses.

The interesting part, to me, is that it worked at all. How was it that I 
was able to convince people to pay such a high mark-up? I have a hypothesis.

My hypothesis on why it worked
------------------------------

I am reading a book called Thinking Fast and Slow. Daniel Kahneman, the author,
suggests based on research that we have two primary modes of thinking:
System 1 and System 2. System 1 processes information subconsciously.
System 2 is active, conscious thought. We bring out System 2 thinking when we
face hard problems. Most people associate their mental "selves" as being
their System 2 mode of thinking. In actuality, much of our lives are governed
by how effective our System 1 mode of thinking processes information.
And it's easily tricked.

My hypothesis is that when the brain sees a set of sunglasses for sale in a 
vending window, it looks them all over and thinkins "Okay, the cheapest one
is set to 30K and the most is 45K. 
Based on my understanding of other vendors in the area,
and conventions of vending, I suspect that its actual price is probably
somewhere around 35K. If I buy that 30K pair, I'm getting a great deal. 
If it turns out to be cheaper, 30K is still not all that much to pay."
All of this, of course, probably happens without consciously thinking about it,
which is why System 1 thinking can be so powerful. 

If conscious thought 
had been engaged, for example if I had been charging more for the sunglasses,
such as 500K or something along those lines, then the sale would have been
prevented. "Those probbaly don't actually cost that much." The would-be
buyer might say. They might consult a price list and find out how
outrageous the prices were, for example. I think of the 500K sunglasses
as the more traditional definition of a scam. It reminds me of how people would
sell XBox boxes on eBay for the same price as an XBox because the buyer
did not pay attention.

The same things happen with deals websites, I've noticed. I watch a deals site
called Slickdeals for a number of years. Members post "deals" which range from
something like $100 off a set of new tires to a discount on headphones. I've
noticed, over time, that the frequency that I check slickdeals is linked
to how many purchases I make. Is it still a deal if I'm purchasing more
things than I need? Am I still "saving money" if I'm spending it more often?
And yet, I still check it from time to time.

Kahneman also brings up the idea of anchoring. In some studies that they did,
they found that if they started with a higher number, participants were more
likely to believe the number and use it (consciously or otherwise) as the 
starting point for their bargaining. As such, by anchoring high on the 
sunglasses, customers used it as their starting point. The cheaper sunglasses,
by comparison, looked like a great deal.

Anyway, let's wrap this all up here shall we?

Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow is an interesting journey into the way that we
think.  The next time you find yourself looking at a deal and thinking about
whether or not to buy it -- consider if you're really getting a good deal or not.
If you see a pair of sunglasses for sale in Ragnarok Online, I would humbly 
suggest you move on (and probably stop playing Ragnarok Online because it is ancient).
