I get scared when I start new things. What if I'm not any good? 
What if others find out that I'm a fraud? 
After a little while, the feeling goes away and I remember that it's 
part of the learning process. 

Starting something new is scary. 
I think it does not have to be that way, so I'd like to offer some
suggestions if you're feeling overwhelmed.


It's uncomfortable
------------------
I remember when I learned to drive with my mom. 
She drove us to a parking lot and got out of the car. 
I moved to the driver's seat and looked around. 
I turned the key. The car started. So far, so good.

_Me_: "Okay, so I press the gas now right?" 

_Her_: "Yeah but don't press too hard."

_Me_: "How much pressure do I use?"

_Her_: "I don't know, you push it. Treat it like it's an egg."

_Me_: "... like an egg how? Is it a hard-boiled egg?"

_Her_: "No. I mean, ... It's not that hard. You just push down."

_Me_: "Sure, it's not that hard to you because you've been doing this for 30 years.
I have never done this, so it's hard."

The good news is that I eventually figured out how to drive. 

I think it's easy to forget, once we've learned something, that it used to be hard.
I think of it like being sick. When I'm sick, the only thing I want is 
feel better. Once I feel better, I completely forgot how it felt to be sick
and don't bother to appreciate being healthy. It's the same thing.


Feeling inadequate
------------------

In a past life, I worked on films. 

I remember when I was a [production assistant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_assistant)
and I overheard the Director of Photography talking to someone. He said:

> "I'm always worried when I show up on set that they'll discover I'm a fraud. 
> Then, I give it a day or two, and I feel like it's fine. No one else knows what they're doing 
> either." 

I think that's a good way to put it.

When I started working as a full-time developer, I felt like an imposter. 
I felt like an imposter for months, actually.
I felt like it was a mistake for the company to hire me.
I felt like I didn't fit in.
My co-workers had worked as professional developers for years and I thought
I was a novice in comparison.
I did not feel like I knew anything or deserved a place at the table. 
None of that was true, really, but fear does strange things to the mind.
It's not logical. 

In reality, I had worked as a developer before. I more-or-less
knew what I was doing, but didn't feel like it, even when people told me I
was doing a good job.

I went home with a headache every day for a month. I had to fully focus my
attention in a way that I did not have much experience doing. I felt depressed.
I wondered if the feeling would go away, because I liked my job, but I did
not like feeling the way I did.

I feel that we do not talk about this feeling of inadequacy enough.
The general idea is [well-documented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
and has been discussed before by many other people. 
It can be intimidating to admit that we feel this way. 
A small voice inside of me usually says:

> "But what if I don't know anything and really am an imposter?"

I try to remember that the feeling goes away and that the voice is wrong.

For me, the feeling went away after I realized, like my friend, that no one
else really knew what they were doing either. I also started to listen
to conference talks on my way into work as a way of improving and read
a few books on best practices. I started meditating again. It also just took
time and supportive friends.

My girlfriend, Carissa, started a transition from her last job into something
new. She's learning more about graphic design and it's 
frustrating to feel like a beginner. She worked as a successful
photographer for years and when you reach a level of mastery, it's uncomfortable
to feel inadequate in a new area. It's hard to encounter something and
be overwhelmed by it but still continue. It requires patience.

"It's gonna take a while."
--------------------------
What I'd like to say is that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and inadequate.
It usually means that you're in the right place; doing the right things,
at least in the short term.
Sometimes simply paying attention to the feeling and acknowledging
that we feel that way is enough to make it go away.
Sometimes it takes more work to close the gap. 
I've found that meditation helps too. I like 
[Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe1-4.html)
as an introductory book.
Either way, it's a good sign that you're on the right path. 
Keep it up and do your best to stick with it.

Ira Glass has a [famous quote](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish)
where he talks about the same thing. "It's gonna take a while. It's normal
to take a while." 

How to help others
------------------

When we trivialize learning something new for other people, it sends a message.
"This is easy. You should know how to do this. Why don't you?" 
It's demoralizing. It makes a hard process harder.

If you see someone else struggling, give them some affirmation
too. I like to tell people about times where I went through a feeling of strong
self-doubt and came out the other side. In fact, I suppose that's what this 
article is trying to do. It's reassuring, as a beginner, to hear that the thing
that feels so hard will one day feel totally normal and okay.

In [The Secret to Raising Smart Kids](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids1/),
Carol Dweck says that children respond better to praise for their effort 
than for being smart. So, let's focus on praising people for putting in the
effort to grow. The results will come later.

Julie Pagano gave a great, and related, talk on 
[imposter syndrome at PyCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY). 
I'd recommend listening to that as she has some great tips too.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, or scared, or worried that you're not good enough --
be patient. Be kind to yourself. It takes time and effort to learn and the process
is not instant, as much as we might like it to be when we're feeling outmatched.
