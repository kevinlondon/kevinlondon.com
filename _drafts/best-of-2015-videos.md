Recommended Software Development Videos

2015, started watching videos in car. Big difference in quality over year.
These are some of the most influential videos I've seen in the last year.
I've watched about 100 conference videos in the last year.


[Beyond PEP 8 - Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=10)

An excellent discussion about how getting stuck in the details of syntax can
distract us from more important topics, especially in code reviews. Definitely
something I started thinking about after this talk. In addition, finally the
talk that switched me from double quoting variables to single quote (for the most part).

[Growing a Language - Guy Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=11)

Guy Steele is a master. This talk is so well formed. Whether or not you use
Java, I think Guy makes some excellent points and the form of the talk
supports all of his ideas. I don't want to spoil any more than that.

[Demanding Professionalism in Software Development - Bob Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0O1VVqRSK0&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=12)

Uncle Bob is a polarizing figure. I think, in this talk, he sets out
a group of reasonable ideas.

[Real Software Engineering - Glenn Vanderburg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=15)

Engineers are held to different standards than other professions. Why is that?
What can we do to become better as engineers and software developers? 
What has gone wrong in our past?


[Inventing on Principle - Bret Victor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=18)

Bret Victor, phew. The ideas are amazing in this. Seeing him come up with
solutions to problems that have a different paradigm is cool to see. I found
that this challenged the way I thought about problems.

[Architecture, the Lost Years - Bob Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=22)

Another Uncle Bob talk. Architecture is the idea that we delay choosing until we must.
Does your software structure tell you anything about the software is constructed?
Thought provoking and my introduction to Uncle Bob.


[Simplicity Matters - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=27)

Rich Hickey seems like a treasure. The Closure community, and the software community as whole,
is lucky to have him tackling hard problems. 

[Transforming your Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python - Raymond Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=38)

Phew, Raymond Hettinger is my personal hero. Idiomatic Python!


[How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters - Joshua Bloch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heh4OeB9A-c&list=FLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w&index=42)

TODO.

[Professional Productivity - Scott Hanselman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS1mnISoG7U&index=38&list=LLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w)

Email is where information goes to die.


[Fast Test, Slow Test - Gary Bernhardt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAxiiRPHS9k&index=88&list=LLlt4ZSW8NUcXLWiB3NMnK_w)

A number of my personal testing philosophies can be traced back to Gary
Bernhardt and to this talk in particular. It covers how test suites become
slow and fragile and how we can write tests that serve us by meeting the 
three primary goals of testing as he lays them out:

1. Prevent regressions
2. Prevent fear
3. Prevent bad design

This talk is a good introduction to high-level concepts in writing smaller, 
focused tests and taking test performance seriously.

[The Magic Tricks of Testing - Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M)

I've been going through a Sandi Metz phase lately. I think all of her talks
are excellent but I think I found this one to be the most applicable.
Some highlights from her talk:

* Don't test private methods
* Isolate the method under test
* Lots of small objects makes testing easier

I don't agree with all of her points and I think that's okay.
It's good to get different perspectives.

[All the Little Things - Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE)

The talk describes the value of small objects and the Open / Closed principle. It
illustrates how to refactor an app without tests and how to apply Open / Closed.
I started thinking about how to use smaller objects and how to use more traditional
Object Oriented design principles after watching this.


[Stop Writing Classes - Jack Diederich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0)

Jack Diederich makes some good points in here. I think, in
general, that I agree with his point and that if we can write small functions
instead of heavy-weight classes with a group of internal state, then we should do that.
If we find ourselves creating lots of similar methods, then that's probably
a class trying to escape.
