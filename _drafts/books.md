title: Software Engineer Growth Resources

A friend recently asked me how I think about getting better as a developer and
what my process had been. I said that I have a pretty broad array of sources
that I've used to learn and realized that I haven't charted anywhere what
recommendations I have for improving and finding interesting tech things.

## Blogs

I don't follow many individual bloggers. Instead, I usually read stories and
articles when they appear on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or in
the comments. That said, I have a few favorites:

* **[Dan Luu](http://danluu.com/)**: One of my favorite technical writers. His
    writing on his experience at [big
    companies](http://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/) led me to consider
    joining [Amazon](http://amazon.com/) over another startup, for example.
    I often reference his post on [normalization of
    deviance](http://danluu.com/wat/) as a model of how we get accustomed to
    weird processes. Finally, he has a list of [great programming
    blogs](http://danluu.com/programming-blogs/) and
    [books](http://danluu.com/programming-books/). That's just a subset.

* **[High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/)**: Good blog on building complex
    systems at scale. I like the [post on Netflix's
    architecture](http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/12/11/netflix-what-happens-when-you-press-play.html)
    as an introduction to the blog.

* **[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)**: Julia writes infectiously exciting blog posts.
    Want to learn about [what happens when you start a process on
    Linux](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/04/exec-will-eat-your-brain/)? What
    about [how to decide what to work
    on](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/)?
    Maybe you didn't before but I'm guessing you're curious now.


## Books

I read fewer software books than I'd like. I have
a hard time sitting down and powering through a full book, unless I'm on a plane
where I have nothing more interesting to distract me. Of the somewhat limited
set of software books I've read, I'd recommend:

* **[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)**: This book
    basically started my career in software. It's more basic than the other
    books on this list but it's _fun_ in a way that most programming books are not.

* **[Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/)**:
    Great introduction to test-driven development, and practical if you're
    working in Python or Django. I like hands-on style books and this one is
    essentially a long tutorial.

* **[Effective
    Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997)**:
    As someone new to Java, it's great like Joshua Bloch explaining best
    practices.

* **[Continuous
    Delivery](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912)**:
    Filled with good advice for automating and improving your processes. Beyond
    explaining DevOps practices, it's good for poking an introspective part of
    your brain to grow and continue thinking about what can be improved.

* **[Cracking the Coding
    Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)**:
    I recommend this book in the [job hunt
    guide](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2016/01/21/job-hunt-guide.html) and stand
    by it even as a general purpose algorithms book. If you go through this
    book, I encourage you to do the problems and not just read the material.

## Talks

One of my secret learning weapons is listening to recorded software-related talks.
I [wrote
a post](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/09/10/10-software-talks-to-listen-to.html)
about a few of the talks I listened to in the car on the way to work.
I think it's a good list of talks to start with, and most of them apply
to programming generally.
I've tried listening to podcasts. They're too _conversational_ for me.

Beyond that, I have a few sources I check:

* **[Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)**: [Gary
    Bernhardt](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt)'s screencast series for
    working professionals. A few years ago I watched through the first season
    and it changed how I use the command line. Although not representative of
    the rest of the screencasts, I love Gary's
    [wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) talk. His Twitter feed
    is entertaining too.

* **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)**: Sounds obvious but it's easy to overlook.
    Most conference talks end up on here, such as [PyCon
    2017](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhliKNQ8g0qoE_zvL8eVg) and [Strange
    Loop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw/playlists).
    Sorting by views is the killer feature for watching software talks on
    YouTube. [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) can be helpful to
    save on bandwidth if you listen while travelling.

* **[Deconstruct
    Conf](https://www.deconstructconf.com/)**: A software conference organized
    by Gary Bernhardt. Maybe it's cheating to include this, since I already
    included Gary. Oh well. I enjoyed
    "[Patterns failed. Why? Should we care?]"(https://www.deconstructconf.com/2017/brian-marick-patterns-failed-why-should-we-care) and look forward to the 2018 videos.
