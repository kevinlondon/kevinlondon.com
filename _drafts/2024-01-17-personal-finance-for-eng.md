## Why should you care?

Educating yourself in personal finance might be one of the highest leverage /
expected value activities you can do for your life.

A career can be a kind of unimaginably long thing. It's hard to fit into our
heads that decisions we make early in the career can have long-tail effects that
are difficult to conceptualize.

In particular, compound interest has a fascinating power. Supposedly, Albert
Einstein said compound interest was the 8th wonder of the world. For
example, if someone invests $100 per month from 25 to 35, and someone else
invests the same amount from 35 to 65, the amount they'll have at 65 will be
approximately _the same amount_ due to compound interest. In other words, the
sooner you can start making your plan, the better your odds of being able to
achieve your financial goals.

Also, I've seen very smart people and well-employed folks get into challenging
financial situations. Or folks who made a good salary
with a lifestyle that crept up until they lived paycheck to paycheck.
While compound interest can be a powerful force when it works in your favor,
getting into debt (particularly credit card debt) cause the same power to work against you.

I've been interested in and studied personal finance since I was about 18. I can
remember sitting on
my community college's library computers between classes, going through
[Morningstar's mutual fund
courses](https://www.morningstar.com/start-investing/classroom) well before I
could possibly invest. I think it's fascinating! As a software engineer, I also
love learning about systems, and what better system to learn about than personal
finance?

## Disclaimers

Before we begin, a few disclaimers:

- **Not financial advice**: I am not a financial professional and have no
  specialized training or licenses in this. While I have had a personal interest in this
  since I was 18, I'm presenting these findings as informational only. In other
  words, please do your own research.
- **Consult a CPA or fee-only financial planner**: If you have an advanced case,
  or a large portfolio, you may find it helpful to talk to a professional.
  Fee-only finacial advisors can be a good resource, in part because they _don't_ have a
  vested interest in managing your portfolio and taking an on-going cut.
  [NAPFA](https://www.napfa.org/) can be a good place to find these folks.
- **Not much of this is specific to software engineering.**: While the title
  talks about software engineering, truthfully this applies to people in any field.
  I mention that because it's the lens from which I'm approaching it.
- **My perspective is very US centric**. My apologies if you're in another country
  as I know those systems less.

## Make a budget

If you research personal finance, one of the first steps (like in [this
flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/16xymii/fire_flow_chart_version_43/))
is creating a budget. This is an important, if unexciting, step! If
you don't do it, you can wind up in this situation:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Food $200<br>Data
$150<br>Rent $800<br>Candles $3,600<br>Utility $150<br>someone who is good at
the economy please help me budget this. my family is dying</p>&mdash; wint

If you're not tracking your spending, there's a good chance you're
spending too much on non-essential items, or those which don't give you much joy.
Either way, even if you think you have a good read on your spend, it's easy to lose track!

There's a range options you can use for preparing and maintaining a budget:

1. Spreadsheet or pen-and-paper. Manual but still works!
2. [You Need a Budget](https://www.ynab.com/): Allows you to track incoming
   money and categorize it into buckets of expected spending. I think this is a
   great way to get started, particularly if you have bigger expenses coming up. It
   requires some discipline to get started and stay with categorizing transactions
   for a bit. Stick with it.
3. [Monarch](https://www.monarchmoney.com/referral/gogh9rwmnl) (affiliate link):
   I've started trying out Monarch as an option for getting an overall picture of
   accounts and money coming in / going out. So far, I like it.

Previously, I'd recommended [Mint](https://mint.com/), which I've used for 14 years (!!).
It's unfortunately going away, and I haven't used Credit Karma, which is replacing it, for its budgeting tools.

## Pay yourself first

One meta point I'd like to make here is: pay yourself first. It can be tempting to look at a bank account balance and treat it as though it's one pot of money from which to pull. If you have automatic payments or investments set up, it can build good habits. In other words, if the money doesn't actually hit or stay in your bank account for long, it's easier to learn to live without it. It helps prevent lifestyle creep.

If you can, live below your means. In other words, try to spend less than you make each month. For example, if you get a raise, you can adjust your savings rate so it automatically gets put into a retirement account or separate account for saving for a down payment.

The other point here is that investing in yourself is often a great investment. Education, health, etc, can all be fairly high leverage for a fairly low long-term cost.t

## Make a Plan

After you've made a budget, you can follow
[a flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/) as a baseline recommendation for how to prioritize
what to do with your funds. In short:

- Pay necessary expenses
- Prioritize paying down high interest debt
- (If possible) save up to your company's 401K match (more on this later)
- Invest according to your goals from there

Do you have short-term goals like
saving up for a car downpayment, getting out of credit card debt, or otherwise?
That'll change your priorities and the amount of risk you can take on.

- Investing Plan Statement
- Write your goals
- Make and stick to a plan
- Add a time delay component to any changes. For example, if planning to change allocation, write a line and see if you still feel like doing that after 30-90 days.
- Annual rebalance
- Saving for home different from saving for retirement in timeline
