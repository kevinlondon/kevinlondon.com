title: My Experience with the Amazon Promotion Process

When I started at Amazon, the promotion process felt like a mystery. How
does the company choose who to promote? What criteria do they use? And why
would they ever want to promote me, especially when I grappled with [impostor
syndrome](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/27/impostor-syndrome-and-me)?

My promotion journey took about 2 years from the moment I first felt ready.
While it was often frustrating, I learned that Amazon's cautious approach to
promotions serves a few purposes:

1. **Consistency at the Next Level**: Amazon promotes engineers who consistently demonstrate
   they are performing at the next job level, reducing the risk of premature promotions.

2. **Minimizing Job Level Shock**: Amazon employees can see each other's job level. As soon as
   someone sees your job level, they set expectations of what individuals at that job level can do,
   so delaying this can protect the individual from being judged too early. This can particularly
   matter for performance evaluations where everyone is measured against their peers.

During this period, I spent about a year preparing for my promotion. I created
detailed work summaries highlighting my contributions and how I was already operating at the
next level. Feedback from a trusted higher-level engineer guided me to broaden my
impact, such as helping other teams avoid mistakes I had encountered.

I applied this feedback to a large project involving coordination with about ten engineers
across several teams. These moments of increased responsibility made me feel like I was
truly functioning as a senior engineer.

After completing the project, I revised my promotion document to align with the next level's criteria.
Despite receiving feedback that my promotion may be denied,
I chose to submit it anyway to learn from the experience.

As expected, the promotion was initially rejected. However, I took the reviewers' feedback
seriously, addressed the gaps, and resubmitted. This time, the promotion was approved!

The promotion process can be long and sometimes frustrating. However, by
understanding the companyâ€™s perspective and remaining open to feedback and
improvement, you can increase your chances of success.
