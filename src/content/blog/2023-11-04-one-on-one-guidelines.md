When I took over one-on-ones for a team of 8 engineers at Amazon, I needed a framework to make these meetings valuable. Here's the template I've refined over 20+ introductory sessions.

### Before the First Meeting

1. **Block Regular Time**: Schedule a consistent time slot
2. **Choose the Right Duration**: 30-45 minutes usually works well
3. **Find a Good Space**: Pick a quiet location or ensure reliable video setup
4. **Review Context**: Understand their current projects and recent work

### First Meeting Structure

Here's what I cover in our first session:

1. **Goals and Expectations**: 
   - What would you like to achieve through these meetings?
   - How can these meetings help your growth?
   - What's worked well (or not) in past one-on-ones?

2. **Communication Style**:
   - How do you prefer to receive feedback?
   - What's the best way to share concerns?
   - Should we keep a shared document for topics?

3. **Current Challenges**:
   - What immediate challenges are you facing?
   - Where could you use support?
   - What's blocking your progress?

### Meeting Formats

Our sessions can be structured or unstructured, based on your preference:

**Structured Format**:
- Follow a regular agenda
- Track progress on [SMART goals](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals)
- Regular check-ins on career development

**Unstructured Format**:
- Open discussion about current work
- Space to explore new ideas
- Flexible agenda based on immediate needs

### Documentation

I take brief notes during our meetings to:
- Track action items
- Remember key discussion points
- Follow up on previous topics

These notes remain private and aren't shared externally.

### Strategic vs Tactical Focus

I aim to focus on strategic, long-term topics rather than day-to-day tactical issues:

**Strategic Topics**:
- Career development
- Team collaboration improvements
- Work-life balance
- Long-term technical growth

**Tactical Topics** (better suited for other channels):
- Code reviews
- Current bug fixes
- Immediate technical questions

### Information Sharing Guidelines

What we discuss remains confidential, with three exceptions:

1. Common team concerns that can be anonymized
2. Information that you explicitly agree to share
3. Serious concerns about harm to yourself or others (I've never needed to use this clause)

If you're starting your own one-on-one series, I hope this framework helps. If we're about to start our one-on-ones together, I'm looking forward to our discussions!
