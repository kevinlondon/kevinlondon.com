description: "A talk about the dangers of technical debt"

Have you ever heard someone say, 'This code sucks. We need to rewrite it.'?

I've been there and it usually doesn't end well. We'll discuss analogies around
continual improvement and how to avoid declaring technical bankruptcy.

I originally gave this talk for a [SoCal Python
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/socalpython/events/233187442/) at
[ChowNow's](https://www.chownow.com) HQ.
