A few years ago, I started researching into credit card bonuses and it's become
a hobby. My wife and I went on our honeymoon using
rewards points and have a few trips coming up in the next year.

It's my opinion that if you use credit cards without considering rewards,
you're leaving money on the table. Many credit cards offer bonuses designed to
get you as a long-term customer. It's possible to systematically use these
bonuses in a clever way to get the following:

* Hotel stays
* Flights
* Cruises
* Cash back

It's intimidating to start and the learning curve can be steep. Credit's scary
to think about and there's a lot of misinformation about travel and credit
scores out there.

This hobby is known as credit card churning, or churning for short.
In this post, I'm going to share what I usually tell people that are interested
in learning more, including which cards to get, and how to do this safely.

## Rules for churning

Churning can be wonderful but there are, of course, some
risks. As such, here's some lessons I've learned:

* Only purchase what you normally would buy.

It can be easy, when spending for credit card bonuses, to justify spending
beyond what you normally would. Track your spending
and, if you catch yourself thinking "Well, I need the bonus..." - stop.

* Track your cards and make sure you meet your signup requirements to get the bonuses.

It's easy to track one or two credit cards if you're going for sign up bonuses.
It's harder if you have 3-5. I use a spreadsheet to track when I applied for
a card, how long I have, and how much I need to spend for the bonus.

* Setup your cards to automatically pay in full from your account.

Don't carry a month to month balance. I like to treat credit cards the same way
I would treat a debit card or cash. Carrying a balance will make you accrue
interest and erase the gains you get from churning.

If you have outstanding credit card debt, then this guide is not for you. Instead,
I'd recommend going to Reddit's
[/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) and pay off your
debts first.

* Research before you jump in

Some credit card issuers, Chase in particular, have rules about how often you
can apply for cards. If you apply for some random store card like Macy's, then
you could be sacrificing a valuable "slot". Doing your research first will allow
you to be prepared for when you start and you'll have a plan.

## Isn't it bad to apply for credit cards?

People believe that applying for credit cards can hurt your credit. In
actuality, it's fine unless you plan to purchase a house in the
next 6 months to a year or you're planning to get a car loan. While average age of
credit is an important factor in your credit score, many factors contribute to
it. Personally speaking, my credit score has gone up since I started pursuing credit
card bonuses.

## How do I start?

### Preparation

1. Make sure you have no outstanding credit card debt. (See above caveats).
2. Read Reddit's [/r/churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning) community.
   They have a wonderful [Credit Card
   Flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/6wzkwj/faq_credit_card_recommendation_flowchart/)
   that covers what I usually recommend. Another good resource is the [Doctor of
   Credit blog](https://www.doctorofcredit.com).
3. Think about what kind of rewards you're interested in. Do you prefer cashback
   or travel? How about airfare vs hotels?
4. Review the Credit Card Flowchart above and pick a credit card.
5. Think about it for a while, make sure you do your reading before you start.
6. Apply!

### When you get your card

1. Enter the card's bonus information in your spreadsheet
2. Set up autopay in full for your new card.
3. Meet your minimum spending requirement
4. Get the points!

### Using the points

This part can be challenging! There's many different ways to use points and they
each have pros and cons. For example, redeeming your points for a gift card is
almost universally **a bad idea**.

The term of art in the community is "cpp" or "cents per point". If you spent
30,000 points on a hotel stay that normally costs $450 dollars, then your
redemption was worth 1.5 cpp ($450 / 30000).

You may have different ways of using points too. For example, if you're using
Chase Ultimate Rewards points, you might be able to transfer them to a hotel
chain or you could redeem them through the Chase Ultimate Rewards Travel portal
for a different rate. It's worth doing your research here!

Helpful resources:

* Reddit [/r/awardtravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/)
* [Award Mapper](http://www.awardmapper.com/): Hotel point search, good starting
    spot.
* [Award Hacker](https://www.awardhacker.com/): Flight point search.

You may come across posts by a travel blogger called The Points Guy. Take his
posts with a grain of salt. His recommendations may be based on which issuers
give the best affiliate rates. Cross-reference other sources to make sure the
advice is good.

### After the first year

If you've gotten the bonus for the card and don't use it as a regular spender,
consider downgrading it to a version of the card that has no fee or cancelling
at the year mark. Issuers will often refund the annual fee if you cancel within
the first month of it being assessed. This is another reason why it's helpful to
have a spreadsheet!

## Okay but... which cards should I get?

Ok, I get it. That's a lot to do. If you're looking for the simplest start, I'd
recommend going with Chase cards first. The single best card, I think, is the
[Chase Ink
Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/small-business-credit-cards/ink-business-preferred).
It currently has a public signup bonus of 80K Chase Ultimate Rewards points,
which should be worth at least $1000 if you redeem them wisely.

It's a business
credit card. it's likely that you already have some kind of business, even
if it's an eBay or Craigslist sales business on the side. You can also use your
Social Security Number instead of an Employer Identification Number if you have
a sole proprietorship.

Beyond that, I'd recommend reviewing the [Reddit
flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/6wzkwj/faq_credit_card_recommendation_flowchart/)
and doing your research. Churning is always changing, so what's good now will
probably not be the best card when you read this.

I hope you enjoy learning more about churning and using your credit cards to
your advantage. It's a fun hobby and it's interesting *because* it changes. Do
your research and you'll be fine. Best of luck!
