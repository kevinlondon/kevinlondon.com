A few years ago, I started researching into credit card bonuses and made
something of a hobby out of it. My wife and I went on our honeymoon using
rewards points and have a few other trips coming up in the next year.

It's my opinion that if you use credit cards without considering the rewards,
you're leaving money on the table. Many credit cards offer bonuses designed to
get you as a long-term customer. It's possible to systematically use these
bonuses in a clever way to get the following:

* Hotel stays
* Flights
* Cruises
* Cash back

It's intimidating to start and the learning curve can be steep. Credit's scary
to think about and there's a lot of misinformation about travel and credit
scores out there.

This hobby is known as credit card churning, or churning for short.
In this post, I'm going to share what I usually tell people that are interested
in learning more, including which cards to get, and how to do this safely.

## Rules for churning

Churning as a hobby can be wonderful but there are, of course, some
risks. As such, here's some lessons I've learned:

* Only purchase what you normally would have bought.

It can be easy, when spending for credit card bonuses, to get caught up in the
bonuses and justify spending beyond what you normally would. Track your spending
and, if you catch yourself thinking "Well, I need the bonus" - stop.

* Track your cards and make sure you meet your signup requirements to get the bonuses.

It's easy to track one or two credit cards if you're going for sign up bonuses.
It's harder if you have 3-5. It's also easy to forget when you applied for
a card, when you need to complete your spending, or how much spending you need
for that particular offer. I recommend keeping a spreadsheet to track this
stuff.

* Setup your cards to automatically pay in full from your account.

Don't carry a month to month balance. If you're the kind of person that carries
a balance, this guide can't help you.

## Isn't it bad to apply for credit cards?

People believe that applying for credit cards can hurt your credit. In
actuality, it does not pose an issue unless you plan to purchase a house in the
next 6 months to a year or planning to get a car loan. While average age of
credit is an important factor in your credit score, many factors contribute and,
personally speaking, my credit score has gone up since I started pursuing credit
card bonuses.

## How do I start?

There's a wealth of information available. I usually recommend
starting with [Chase](https://www.chase.com) cards first, since they have the
most restrictions, and then
going into other issuers like American Express if you're still looking.

I trust the Reddit
[/r/churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning) community (especially their
[Credit Card
Flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/6wzkwj/faq_credit_card_recommendation_flowchart/)
and [Doctor of Credit](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/)
the most. A nice thing about the Reddit community is that you can get specific
feedback from people that keep up with this in the What Card Wednesday threads.
