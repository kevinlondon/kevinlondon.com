Preparing for technical interviews can feel overwhelming!
There's so much to learn and keep in mind.
I'm helping a friend prepare for technical interviews by running mock interviews
with them and offering feedback.

In this post, I'll share ways to increase your chances of success from my
experience as a candidate and interviewer.

## Sample Agenda

When I lead interviews (mock or no), I like to start by offering an agenda for
the interview so the candidate is familiar with what we're going to cover.
Here's what I like to cover:

1. **Overview**: Outline for the topics we'll discuss in the interview.
2. **Brief introductions**: Backgrounds in brief.
3. **Behavioral and situational questions**: Exploring scenarios to evaluate behavioral skills.
4. **Technical questions**: Delving into system design / coding.
5. **Candidate questions**: Giving the candidate an opportunity to interview me.

## The Interviewer's Responsibility

As an interviewer, it is my responsibility to create a comfortable
and collaborative environment that allows you to perform at your best.
We know that it can be difficult / stressful to interview since we've done it too.

I want to capture as much information as possible to help the company make an
informed hiring decision. Lastly, I strive to ensure a positive outcome for the candidate regardless of the outcome.

## Brief Introductions

Be brief and offer the interviewer the chance to ask more if they're interested.
In about 30 seconds to one minute, aim to cover your name, position, career summary,
and relevant background.

Here's my sample introduction as an interviewer:

> My name is Kevin London. I'm a Software Engineer at Snapchat and I've been here
> for about a year. I'm on the A/B team and we build tools
> for internal teams to run tests to evaluate whether customers like features
> before we launch them more broadly. I've worked as a software engineer for about
> ten years and worked at startups and at Amazon for about four years prior to joining Snap.

You want to give the interviewer enough to get a picture of you and your
background if they haven't had a chance to review your resume. This introduction
is also an opportunity to contextualize the stories you may offer in the coming
behavioral interview questions.

Practice your introduction with a friend or two to ensure you're providing
enough context about yourself without going too long.

## Behavioral Questions

### Preparation

When you're preparing for behavioral interviews, familiarize yourself with the
[STAR
format](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique).
Interviewers want to know about your actions and the results, since those show
the areas that are most under your control.

#### Company Values

Research the company's values and craft a story for each one.
These stories should illustrate how you demonstrate the company's values through your actions.

I prefer writing on paper for this part, though typing is probably fine too.

If you don't feel like the story strongly illustrates your values, consider finding another one
or seeing if there's an area or action that you overlooked that would be helpful.

### Narrative Structure

As humans, we're inherently wired to be more interested by and engaged in stories.
If you can, frame your anecdotes as a story using narrative structures
such as the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).

In this structure, we start [_in media
res_](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes) and the hero is
faced with a big obstacle that upends
their day-to-day. They fight against the odds and may have an ["all is
lost"](https://storygrid.com/the-all-is-lost-moment-2/) moment. Then, at the
end,
they emerge victorious and solve the problem.

This structure helps keep interviewers engaged and it puts an emphasis on your
actions and what value you would bring to the company.

### Phoenix Stories

Even if a story reflects a challenging experience, it's essential to showcase your resilience and growth. Consider how you recovered from failure and emphasize the positive outcomes or lessons learned. Think of these stories as your personal "phoenix stories" that demonstrate transformation and growth.

In lore, a phoenix is a bird that dies and is reborn from its ashes.
What was born out of the failure you experienced?

### Be Specific

If an interviewer asks you a broad question like "How do you handle conflict?",
offer a specific example in response rather than a general one.

For example, here is a broad answer:

> I try to avoid conflict with coworkers by building alignment and listening to
> their concerns. I like to understand what they're thinking and collaborate with
> them.

And, conversely, here is a fictional specific answer:

> I like to make sure we understand each other's viewpoint when there's conflict.

> For example, I led a design to build a new thumbnail generation system at a
> previous company. I wrote a design document for it and presented it to the team.
> One teammate asked questions about how it would scale and disagreed with the
> overall approach in the document. I offered to follow-up with them offline and
> scheduled a 1:1.

> When we discussed, they pointed out a few areas where the
> service wouldn't scale well, such as if we had a batch upload or if one of our
> dependencies went down. I thanked them and incorporated their feedback in the
> design. They had some concerns about the architecture as well, so I walked them
> through the decisionmaking process and how I arrived at that conclusion. At the
> end, they agreed with the overall approach and we decided to move forward.

> I built out the service, and I'm grateful they identified the
> scaling gap. We were able to handle a huge batch of images uploaded before Black
> Friday and the thumbnailing system worked without issue."

In the first example, as an interviewer, I only get limited feedback about how
this person handles conflict. I understand how they like to handle conflict but
not necessarily how they do.

### Favor "I" over "We"

If you worked on a team project, clearly define your individual contributions.
Specify whether you led the project or if you made significant decisions.
Distinguishing your role within the team showcases your personal skills and
expertise.

## Technical Interviews

0. Ask clarifying questions before you start. Make sure you understand the
   problem's scope and intent before diving in.
1. Express your plan for solving the problem before you start writing code.
2. When you're stuck, start thinking about how you'd solve the problem manually
   using the example.
3. If the editor has a run function, don't click run until you've gone through
   an example and checked that the code should do what you want. Be a human
   computer.

### Know Your Language

Practice and familiarize yourself with your chosen programming language. While
you don't need to memorize every detail, get comfortable with
fundamental programming concepts, syntax, and common data structures.

As an interviewer, I don't expect a candidate to have memorized the syntax for
obscure data structures (such as Python's heapq module), though I would expect
them to be comfortable writing loops, control statements, variables, etc.

### Hints

The interviewer may offer hints if you encounter difficulties.

Pause and consider what they might be
trying to tell you. If a candidate ignores hints and continues on their existing
path, that can be a concern for interviewers. Likewise, if a candidate requires
more hints than normal, that could be a concern as well. I'll only offer a hint
if we've been stuck in one place for a while, and I'll note it that I did so for
evaluation.

### Do Mocks!

Ask a friend to do mock interviews with you. Once you're done with the interview,
if you're the candidate, think about what you could do better and offer
this to see if you're aligned with the mock interviewer.

## Closing Thoughts

Mastering technical interviews requires a combination of preparation, practice,
and effective storytelling. By following the strategies in this post, you can increase your chances of securing your dream job. Interviews are not only about
showcasing your technical skills but also about demonstrating your ability to
collaborate, adapt, and grow as a professional.

Good luck!
