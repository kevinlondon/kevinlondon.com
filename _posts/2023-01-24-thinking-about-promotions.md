When I worked at Amazon, I initally found the promotion process mysterious. How
does the business decide who to promote? What criteria do they use? And why
would they ever want to promote *me*, an engineer suffering from [impostor
syndrome](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/27/impostor-syndrome-and-me)?

My promotion journey took about 2 years from I first thought I was ready to
think about promotion. While I found it frustrating at times,
I came to realize that Amazon took a cautious approach to promotions for a few
reasons:

1. Amazon wants to promote engineers who consistently demonstrate they're at the
   next level. This helps to de-risk promoting someone before they are ready.
2. Amazon's public job levels come with different expectations, so delaying
   promotion until someone is ready protects them from being judged too soon.

During my journey towards promotion, I spent about a year preparing.  I created
work summaries that detailed my contributions and how I was operating at the
next level. When I reviewed these documents with a higher-level engineer, they
pointed out areas where I could expand my impact. For example, they asked me how
I had helped other teams avoid the mistakes I had encountered.

I took this feedback to heart when I worked on a larger project that spanned
teams and required coordination with about 10 engineers. I had many moments
where I thought to myself, "This is what it feels like to operate as a senior
engineer." Each time, I realized that there I still had more to learn.
Promotions at Amazon happen when you are consistently operating at the next
level. So, any time I didn't feel ready, it meant I had an opportunity to
improve.

After we shipped the project, I revised my promotion document and made sure
I met the next level criteria I received feedback that the promotion may get
denied, but I decided to go through with it anyway. I wanted to find out my
weaknesses and submitting and trying again later was the best way to do that. As
expected, the reviewers rejected the promotion. Again, I learned from the
experience, and was able to improve for the next time, when the promotion went
through!

In conclusion, the promotion process can be a long and sometimes frustrating
journey. With a better understanding of the companyâ€™s perspective and
a willingness to learn and improve, you can increase your chances of success.
Keep pushing and striving to improve and you will (hopefully!) be recognized for
your efforts.
