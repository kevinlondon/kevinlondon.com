It's hard to know where to start when preparing a talk and everyone has
a different process that feels comfortable for them. I've experimented
and given four talks so far and I feel like I learn something new every time.
Here's my current process:

1. Pick a topic.
2. Write about it.
3. Pick the points you want the audience to come away with.
4. Write the outline on paper
5. Prepare a first draft of slides.
6. Try to give the talk aloud, warts and all.
7. Research areas where I feel the talk is weak.
8. Practice more.
9. Finalize slides.
10. Practice as much as possible.
11. Give the talk!

No one has ever said "It's a simple 11 point plan!" and meant it. 
That said, most of these go by quickly. Let's go into each item in detail.


1. Pick a Topic
---------------

I sometimes get stuck when I try to come up with a topic. 
Good news: You do not have to be an expert to give a talk. 

I pick topics I feel like I know but I'd like to learn more about. 
The topics I've chosen tend to come from one of the following:

1. A question someone has asked me (e.g. How do we write good tests for code?)
2. Something I had to figure out (e.g. How do I do code reviews?)
3. Something I'd like to learn more about (e.g. What should I know about application security?)

I find that presenting a topic [cements what I've
learned](http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/) and helps me feel
more like an expert in that area. 


2. Write About It
-----------------

I like to write a long-form blog post on the topic before I continue.
I think it has a few key benefit that make the rest of the process easier:

1. You're forced to clarify what you think is important about the topic.
2. You can get preliminary feedback and adjust accordingly
3. You can later point talk attendees to additional material
if they'd like to learn more.
4. You gain confidence on the subject.


When giving a talk, my goal is to cover an idea in a way that sticks around
with the audience after they leave. 
Blog posts, however, can serve as a reference.

For example, I wrote about [code
reviews](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html)
before I gave a talk on them. My talk covered many of the same points but it
also provided more context and personal examples.

If you can, seek out feedback on your blog post.
I find it's gentler to correct mistakes at this stage than in later ones.
I also use the post as a way to tell if what I'm writing about would be
interesting for attendees.


3. Pick the Primary Points
--------------------------

Great talks contain a few simple points.  A common recommendation I've read is
that you should pick the top idea that you'd like people to leave with and
perhaps 2-3 points that support it.  Anything else and it can be hard to retain
it. 

Picking the primary focus of your talk allows you to streamline. 
The typical 30 minute slot will not be long enough to go
into depth on a topic. That's okay.

I like to write out primary ideas on paper and see which ones I feel strongly
about. Something about writing on paper helps me condense ideas more
effectively. I write too much and then edit it down.


4. Write the Rough Outline
--------------------------

I think of the outline as a trimmed down, simpler version of the blog post
that we completed earlier. I include as many anecdotes and personal stories
as possible in the outline so I remember to include them in the talk. This is
not something I release so I don't bother to edit it much. If I spend too
much time on the outline, I feel tempted to read from it. Do not do that.


5. Prepare a First Draft of the Slides
--------------------------------------

At this point, I like to create the first pass on the slides. I use 
big text and no more than a few words per slide. The less text that you can
put on the slides, the better. It becomes too tempting to read slides and
that can prevent you from connecting with the audience.

I use these slides so that I have something to advance through and to see what 
parts I remember and where I stumble.

If I'm giving a 30 minute talk, I aim for something like 30-60 slides. 
The style doesn't matter because the slides will probably change.

6. Practice the Talk Out Loud
-----------------------------

I find the first read of a talk intimidating because it tells me
how well prepared I feel and what areas need improvement.  I time myself
and advance through my slides as I talk. Sometimes I'll make notes as I go if
I feel particularly stuck. After I do a runthrough, I make notes
about what felt weak and what felt good. 


7. Research Weak Spots
------------------------------------------------

What academic articles are available on my topic? Are there other blog posts?
Have others given recorded talks that I can watch?
After I finish the research, I continue adding slides where I need help 
and removing ones that feel extraneous.


8. Practice More
----------------

I like to time the talk and give it aloud as though I were presenting it,
usually 2-3 more times. Sometimes I'll pick a friend to present to them in order
to get some feedback on the content of the presentation. The slides can still be
temporary.

9. Finalize slides.
-------------------

Once I feel good about the presentation's content, I like to go back through and
finalize both the text and the style of the slides. I follow the [Zach Holman
philosophy](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/) of
choosing the biggest font you can get away with.

Here's a couple examples from my previous talks:

* [Intro to Code Reviews](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/06/25/intro-to-code-reviews-talk.html)
* [Finding Vulnerabilities with Bandit](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/09/24/finding-vulnerabilities-with-bandit.html)

10. One Final Practice
----------------------

I do one practice with the final slides. Presenting it to a small group can be
a great confidence builder. If that's not possible, I practice and time it without
stopping for any reason. I think recovering from problems can be as important
as how delivering the content, particularly in front of others.


11. Give the talk!
------------------

The easy part. 

If you've practiced the talk 4-5 times, you should have it down
by this point. It's nerve-wracking to wait before getting up to give a talk
but I find that once I start, it feels natural. Some important points 
to remember during the talk itself: 

* Slow down. 
* Speak clearly.
* Make eye contact.

Questions usually follow the talk but they're not as scary as you might imagine.
I like questions. It shows where I could improve or clarify the
presentation in the future. Leave a few minutes for discussion and be 
sure to repeat the questions that are asked.


Bonus: Post the Slides Online
-----------------------------

Attendees may want to refer to them or you may find yourself referencing
the slides for a post like this one!


Thanks for reading, I hope that's helpful if you're planning to prepare a talk.
If you have questions about what would make a good topic or you get stuck,
please feel free to contact me! I'd love to help.
