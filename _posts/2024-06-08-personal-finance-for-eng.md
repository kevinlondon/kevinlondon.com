Educating yourself in personal finance might be one of the highest leverage
activities you can do to achieve your financial goals.
As a software engineer, I love learning about systems, and what better system to learn about than personal finance?

Take compound interest, for example. If someone invests $100 per month from ages
25 to 35, and someone else invests the same amount from 35 to 65, the amount
theyâ€™ll have at 65 will be approximately the same due to compound interest. The
sooner you can start
making and following a plan, the better your chances of achieving your
financial goals.

It's hard to grasp that decisions we make early in our careers can
have long-term implications. We quickly learn not to touch a hot stove
because it's immediately painful, but some financial decisions may not be felt
for a long time.

Financial concepts, like compound interest, can be
powerful forces when they work in your favor. On the flip side, getting into
debt (particularly credit card debt) can cause the same power to work against you.

## Disclaimers

Before we dive in, a few disclaimers:

- **Not financial advice**: I am not a financial professional and have no
  specialized training or licenses. I'm presenting these findings as
  informational only. Please do your own research.
- **Consult a CPA or fee-only financial planner**:
  If you have a complex financial situation or a large portfolio, it may be
  helpful to talk to a professional. Fee-only financial advisors can be a
  good resource, as they don't have a vested interest in managing
  your portfolio and taking an ongoing cut. [NAPFA](https://www.napfa.org/) is
  a good place to find these folks.
- **Not specific to
  software engineering.**: While the title talks about software engineering,
  this post applies to people in any field. I mention it because it's the
  lens I use.
- **US-centric perspective**. My
  apologies if you're in another country as I know those systems less.

## Make a budget

If you research personal finance, one of the first steps (like in [this
flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/16xymii/fire_flow_chart_version_43/))
they recommend is creating a budget. It's an important, if unexciting,
step!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Food $200<br>Data
$150<br>Rent $800<br>Candles $3,600<br>Utility $150<br>someone who is good at
the economy please help me budget this. my family is dying</p>&mdash; wint

If you're not tracking your spending, there's a good chance you're spending more than you
think on non-essential items or those which don't give you joy. Either
way, it's easy to lose track!

Options for preparing and maintaining a budget:

1. Spreadsheet or pen-and-paper. Manual but effective!
2. [You Need a
   Budget](https://www.ynab.com/): Allows you to track incoming money and
   categorize it into buckets of expected spending. Great for specific goals
   like buying a house.

I use Monarch to get an overall picture of
accounts and money flow. So far, I like it.

## Pay yourself first

If you can, live below your means. Try to spend less than you
make each month. For example, if you get a raise, adjust your savings
rate so it automatically gets put into a retirement account or separate savings account.

It can be tempting to treat a bank account balance like one big pot of money.
Setting up automatic payments and investments builds good habits.
If the money doesn't stay in
your bank account for long, it's easier to learn to live without it.

Lastly, investing in yourself is often a great investment.
Education, health, etc, can all be high leverage for a low long-term cost.

## Make a Plan

Do you have short-term goals like saving up for a car or getting out
of credit card debt? That'll change your priorities and the
amount of risk you can take on.

After you've made a budget, you can follow [a
flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/)
for recommendations.

In short:

1. Pay necessary expenses
2. Prioritize paying down high interest debt
3. (If possible) save up to your company's 401K match (more on this later)
4. Invest according to your goals from there

### Investment Policy Statements

Having a plan is helpful! I suggest creating an [Investment Policy Statement
(IPS)](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement). It can
include your goals and your plan for managing investments. Add a time delay component
to any changes. Write what you're planning to change
and see if you still want to make that change after 30-90 days before implementing it.

### Dealing with emotion

We're emotional creatures. Even when
we think we can handle a big loss, seeing it in practice can feel different.
We're wired to pay more attention to painful losses than the gains.
The best way to deal with emotion is to make and stick to
a plan.

## Long term savings: Pretax vs Post Tax vs Taxable

As part of your plan, consider how you want to save for long-term goals,
like retirement. Understanding differences between
pre-tax, post-tax, and taxable accounts can be helpful.

Here's a brief summary of the most common account types:

- **401k**: Employee-sponsored retirement plan that allows you to contribute
  pre-tax income towards investments. This results in immediate tax savings
  because it lowers your taxable income for the year. When you go to withdraw
  from the account in retirement, it's subject to income tax.
- **Roth IRA**: Individual retirement account that allows tax-free
  growth and withdrawals. Contributions are made with
  after-tax dollars, meaning you don't receive an immediate tax deduction for your
  contributions. However, withdrawals in retirement, including earnings,
  are tax-free.
- **Brokerage account**: Taxable account that
  allows you to buy and sell a range of investments. Unlike retirement
  accounts, contributions here are made with after-tax dollars, and you don't receive any special tax
  advantages.

This is a non-exhaustive list, but these are the ones you're most likely to encounter.

## Investment choices & philosophy

If you're ready to start thinking about investments, here's a few considerations and recommendations:

- **Diversify**: Spread your investments across companies, industries, and investment types to reduce risk.
  By diversifying, you can
  minimize individual losses and improve your portfolio's overall stability.
- **Stock vs bond**: Stocks represent company ownership and  
  have potential for higher return but come with
  higher volatility and risk. Bonds are issued
  by governments or corporations and provide regular interest payments
  with typically more stability. Balance between stocks and bonds based on your
  risk tolerance, goals, and time horizon.
- **US vs International**: Investing in global markets can help with
  diversification. While the US stock market has delivered strong
  returns, international markets offer access to more industries and
  emerging markets with growth potential.
- **Favor passive funds over active management**:
  Research shows that actively managed funds often underperform
  passive index funds over the long term, usually because of higher fees and lower
  diversification. Passive funds, such as index funds and
  exchange-traded funds (ETFs), follow a stock market index, allowing for
  diversification at lower cost.
- **Target date funds**: These mutual
  funds automatically adjust their asset allocation based on your
  target retirement date. They start with a higher allocation to
  stocks in the early years and gradually shift towards more
  conservative investments (bonds) as your retirement approaches. They're
  a great option if you're just starting out or prefer a hands-off approach to
  investing.

## Advanced Topics

As you become more experienced in personal finance and investing, you may
be interested in exploring more advanced topics. Here's some I recommend researching:

- **What to do with company stock**: If you receive company stock as part of
  your compensation, consider how you want to manage it.
  Holding company stock can provide great upside
  if the company performs well, though it also exposes you to risk if the price declines.
  For example, if you worked at Enron before it went under and retained all your
  company stock, you may have lost your job as well as your portfolio's value.
- **Backdoor Roth IRA**: Allows higher-income folks to contribute to a Roth IRA indirectly,
  bypassing the income limits for direct Roth contributions.
- **Mega Backdoor Roth**: Takes the concept of the backdoor Roth one step further
  by using employer retirement plans, such as
  a 401k or 403b, to go beyond the traditional 401k annual maximum.
- **529 Plans**: Allows families to save for future education expenses, such as
  tuitition or room and board. They grow tax-free and some states offer tax
  advantages for contributing to them.
- **Donor-Advised Funds**: A way to give to charity and perhaps gain some tax advantages.
