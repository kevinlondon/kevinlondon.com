After four years at Amazon, today is my last day.
I'd like to look back and share my take-aways.

When I joined Amazon, I wanted to learn what made Amazon successful across so
many industries. After four years, I can say Amazon's
engineering culture and infusion of [Leadership
Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) (LPs) makes it successful.
Here's what I'm taking from my time, in LP language:

#### Customer Obsession

> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to
earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors,
they obsess over customers.

To be successful at Amazon, there's a simple formula (though challenging in practice!):
1. Determine what customers need most.
2. Build it.

It took me ages to internalize this!
Even years into my tenure at Amazon, I presented designs that received as
their first questions: "What customer problem are we solving? What use cases
do we need to address?". This feedback helped me focus on how to best serve the
customer.

At Amazon, there's more things to do and problems to solve than time to do them.
Prioritizing what to build boils down to determining the most
impactful customer challenges.

#### Ownership

> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value
for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just
their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."

At Amazon, engineering owns end-to-end development, including:
1. Pitching an idea
2. Design and aligning with other teams
4. Planning and implemention
5. Project launch and maintenance

I've learned so much from leading projects through the end-to-end software
development lifecycle. And I've never heard "that's not my job"
from successful folks at Amazon.

For [Amp](https://www.onamp.com/), I led call-in, which is a feature that
allows listeners to become a participant on a live Amp show.
At launch, we handed off the project to new owners, who have been wonderful. I've
participated in follow-up discussions about how we can keep making call-in
better for our customers, even though I no longer owning or lead it. I'm
looking forward to see how call-in continues to improve over time!

#### Learn and Be Curious

> Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They
are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

I've had moments at Amazon where I needed to
immediately understand an unfamiliar domain. For example, on call-in, we needed
to write the front end iOS app components in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).
I had no professional experience working in the language and needed to lead the
effort for our team. We learned and taught ourselves the language and idioms
through online resources as we came across the problems.
To Amazon's credit, they encourage learning and growth
and I'm hoping to bring that with me too.

#### Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

> Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing,
more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun
at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my
fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what's next?
Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees' personal success,
whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

One final lesson I take away is how much your team and manager impacts your
happiness. I've been fortunate to have worked with a wonderful team and managers
in my time at Amazon. Watching the team grow, lead with empathy, and build
relationships has been gratifying. I'll miss working with my team.

### What's Next

I had a wonderful time at Amazon over the last four years. If you're curious to hear
more, or have questions, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to chat. I'm
looking forward to starting my next adventure and sharing more soon!
