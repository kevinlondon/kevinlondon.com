I've gone between software engineering and film for most of my career.
People often wonder about my unusual career path so I'd like to share how
I wound up here.

As a kid, the closest thing I did to programming was making custom maps for
Starcraft, which is like programming small games. The year
before I planned to start Comp Sci courses in High School, we moved to
California. My new school didn't offer the same courses so I wound up taking
film production classes and participating in the film club instead.

After high school, I pursued Computer Science at a community college.
As I finished my Associates Degree in Computer Science, my interests back
shifted to photography and video. I took a break from school and freelanced on
film sets in Los Angeles before transferring to California State University Long
Beach to major in film production.

In my senior year, I had the opportunity to intern at Light Iron, which was, at
the time, a small start-up post-production facility that specialized in color
correction. It had 9 employees when I joined, including me, and
most of them were founders. The month I started, I attended the
premiere of Light Iron's largest project to date -- The Social Network by David
Fincher. Though the company was small, they worked on big things.
While interning at Light Iron, I had the opportunity to work in many different
areas, from creative to technical. I continued working there beyond the
internship and stayed on after graduating from Cal State Long Beach.

After graduation, I asked the Chief Technology Officer if I could transition
into a more technical role and he agreed. In my spare time, I learned about
software engineering through Hackers News and Massively Online Open Courses
(MOOCs). Over time, I picked up small scripting tasks at work to automate manual
and inefficinet processes. I wrote applications to
handle tasks such as validating integrity of media and archiving footage to
long-term tape storage.

I decided to pursue software engineering full-time. I enrolled in
Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Computer Science program when it debuted.
I knew I could write applications and I understood some fundamentals from my
previous MOOC studies, so I viewed this as an opportunity to "eat my broccoli".
It would be good for me even if it would be a little uncomfortable for a few
years. I moved on from Light Iron to work at a film-tech company as a full-time
software engineer and started this blog while working there.

I've since completed my Masters degree and worked at a few different
places. I'm still at the intersection of film and technology at Amazon
since I'm working on Prime Video. It's been an interesting path.

My take-away is that it's never too late to start moving in the direction of
your passion. Carer paths can be unpredictable and that's a good thing.
I'm thrilled I'm able to work full time as a software engineer and
grateful for the good fortune I've had.
